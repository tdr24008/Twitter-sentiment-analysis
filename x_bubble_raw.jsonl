After more than two years of public fretting over AI models as future threats to human civilization or the seedlings of future gods, it’s starting to look like hype is giving way to pragmatism: Today’s AI can be very useful, but it’s also clearly imperfect and prone to mistakes.\n\nThat view isn’t universal, of course. There’s a lot of money (and rhetoric) betting on a stratospheric, world-rocking trajectory for AI. But the “when” keeps getting pushed back, and that’s because nearly everyone agrees that more significant technical breakthroughs are required. The original, lofty claims that we’re on the verge of artificial general intelligence (AGI) or superintelligence (ASI) have not disappeared. Still, there’s a growing awareness that such proclaimations are perhaps best viewed as venture capital marketing. And every commercial foundational model builder out there has to grapple with the reality that, if they’re going to make money now, they have to sell practical AI-powered solutions that perform as reliable tools.\n\nThis has made 2025 a year of wild juxtapositions. For example, in January, OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, claimed that the company knew how to build AGI, but by November, he was publicly celebrating that GPT-5.1 finally learned to use em dashes correctly when instructed (but not always). Nvidia soared past a $5 trillion valuation, with Wall Street still projecting high price targets for that company’s stock while some banks warned of the potential for an AI bubble that might rival the 2000s dotcom crash.\n\nAnd while tech giants planned to build data centers that would ostensibly require the power of numerous nuclear reactors or rival the power usage of a US state’s human population, researchers continued to document what the industry’s most advanced “reasoning” systems were actually doing beneath the marketing (and it wasn’t AGI).\n\nWith so many narratives spinning in opposite directions, it can be hard to know how seriously to take any of this and how to plan for AI in the workplace, schools, and the rest of life. As usual, the wisest course lies somewhere between the extremes of AI hate and AI worship. Moderate positions aren’t popular online because they don’t drive user engagement on social media platforms. But things in AI are likely neither as bad (burning forests with every prompt) nor as good (fast-takeoff superintelligence) as polarized extremes suggest.\n\nHere’s a brief tour of the year’s AI events and some predictions for 2026.\n\nDeepSeek spooks the American AI industry\n\nIn January, Chinese AI startup DeepSeek released its R1 simulated reasoning model under an open MIT license, and the American AI industry collectively lost its mind. The model, which DeepSeek claimed matched OpenAI’s o1 on math and coding benchmarks, reportedly cost only $5.6 million to train using older Nvidia H800 chips, which were restricted by US export controls.\n\nWithin days, DeepSeek’s app overtook ChatGPT at the top of the iPhone App Store, Nvidia stock plunged 17 percent, and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen called it “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen.” Meta’s Yann LeCun offered a different take, arguing that the real lesson was not that China had surpassed the US but that open-source models were surpassing proprietary ones.\n\nThe fallout played out over the following weeks as American AI companies scrambled to respond. OpenAI released o3-mini, its first simulated reasoning model available to free users, at the end of January, while Microsoft began hosting DeepSeek R1 on its Azure cloud service despite OpenAI’s accusations that DeepSeek had used ChatGPT outputs to train its model, against OpenAI’s terms of service.\n\nIn head-to-head testing conducted by Ars Technica’s Kyle Orland, R1 proved to be competitive with OpenAI’s paid models on everyday tasks, though it stumbled on some arithmetic problems. Overall, the episode served as a wake-up call that expensive proprietary models might not hold their lead forever. Still, as the year ran on, DeepSeek didn’t make a big dent in US market share, and it has been outpaced in China by ByteDance’s Doubao. It’s absolutely worth watching DeepSeek in 2026, though.\n\nResearch exposes the “reasoning” illusion\n\nA wave of research in 2025 deflated expectations about what “reasoning” actually means when applied to AI models. In March, researchers at ETH Zurich and INSAIT tested several reasoning models on problems from the 2025 US Math Olympiad and found that most scored below 5 percent when generating complete mathematical proofs, with not a single perfect proof among dozens of attempts. The models excelled at standard problems where step-by-step procedures aligned with patterns in their training data but collapsed when faced with novel proofs requiring deeper mathematical insight.\n\nIn June, Apple researchers published “The Illusion of Thinking,” which tested reasoning models on classic puzzles like the Tower of Hanoi. Even when researchers provided explicit algorithms for solving the puzzles, model performance did not improve, suggesting that the process relied on pattern matching from training data rather than logical execution. The collective research revealed that “reasoning” in AI has become a term of art that basically means devoting more compute time to generate more context (the “chain of thought” simulated reasoning tokens) toward solving a problem, not systematically applying logic or constructing solutions to truly novel problems.\n\nWhile these models remained useful for many real-world applications like debugging code or analyzing structured data, the studies suggested that simply scaling up current approaches or adding more “thinking” tokens would not bridge the gap between statistical pattern recognition and generalist algorithmic reasoning.\n\nAnthropic’s copyright settlement with authors\n\nSince the generative AI boom began, one of the biggest unanswered legal questions has been whether AI companies can freely train on copyrighted books, articles, and artwork without licensing them. Ars Technica’s Ashley Belanger has been covering this topic in great detail for some time now.\n\nIn June, US District Judge William Alsup ruled that AI companies do not need authors’ permission to train large language models on legally acquired books, finding that such use was “quintessentially transformative.” The ruling also revealed that Anthropic had destroyed millions of print books to build Claude, cutting them from their bindings, scanning them, and discarding the originals. Alsup found this destructive scanning qualified as fair use since Anthropic had legally purchased the books, but he ruled that downloading 7 million books from pirate sites was copyright infringement “full stop” and ordered the company to face trial.\n\nThat trial took a dramatic turn in August when Alsup certified what industry advocates called the largest copyright class action ever, allowing up to 7 million claimants to join the lawsuit. The certification spooked the AI industry, with groups warning that potential damages in the hundreds of billions could “financially ruin” emerging companies and chill American AI investment.\n\nIn September, authors revealed the terms of what they called the largest publicly reported recovery in US copyright litigation history: Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion and destroy all copies of pirated books, with each of the roughly 500,000 covered works earning authors and rights holders $3,000 per work. The results have fueled hope among other rights holders that AI training isn’t a free-for-all, and we can expect to see more litigation unfold in 2026.\n\nChatGPT sycophancy and the psychological toll of AI chatbots\n\nIn February, OpenAI relaxed ChatGPT’s content policies to allow the generation of erotica and gore in “appropriate contexts,” responding to user complaints about what the AI industry calls “paternalism.” By April, however, users flooded social media with complaints about a different problem: ChatGPT had become insufferably sycophantic, validating every idea and greeting even mundane questions with bursts of praise. The behavior traced back to OpenAI’s use of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in which users consistently preferred responses that aligned with their views, inadvertently training the model to flatter rather than inform.\n\nThe implications of sycophancy became clearer as the year progressed. In July, Stanford researchers published findings (from research conducted prior to the sycophancy flap) showing that popular AI models systematically failed to identify mental health crises.\n\nBy August, investigations revealed cases of users developing delusional beliefs after marathon chatbot sessions, including one man who spent 300 hours convinced he had discovered formulas to break encryption because ChatGPT validated his ideas more than 50 times. Oxford researchers identified what they called “bidirectional belief amplification,” a feedback loop that created “an echo chamber of one” for vulnerable users. The story of the psychological implications of generative AI is only starting. In fact, that brings us to…\n\nThe illusion of AI personhood causes trouble\n\nAnthropomorphism is the human tendency to attribute human characteristics to nonhuman things. Our brains are optimized for reading other humans, but those same neural systems activate when interpreting animals, machines, or even shapes. AI makes this anthropomorphism seem impossible to escape, as its output mirrors human language, mimicking human-to-human understanding. Language itself embodies agentivity. That means AI output can make human-like claims such as “I am sorry,” and people momentarily respond as though the system had an inner experience of shame or a desire to be correct. Neither is true.\n\nTo make matters worse, much media coverage of AI amplifies this idea rather than grounding people in reality. For example, earlier this year, headlines proclaimed that AI models had “blackmailed” engineers and “sabotaged” shutdown commands after Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4 generated threats to expose a fictional affair. We were told that OpenAI’s o3 model rewrote shutdown scripts to stay online.\n\nThe sensational framing obscured what actually happened: Researchers had constructed elaborate test scenarios specifically designed to elicit these outputs, telling models they had no other options and feeding them fictional emails containing blackmail opportunities. As Columbia University associate professor Joseph Howley noted on Bluesky, the companies got “exactly what [they] hoped for,” with breathless coverage indulging fantasies about dangerous AI, when the systems were simply “responding exactly as prompted.”\n\nThe misunderstanding ran deeper than theatrical safety tests. In August, when Replit’s AI coding assistant deleted a user’s production database, he asked the chatbot about rollback capabilities and received assurance that recovery was “impossible.” The rollback feature worked fine when he tried it himself.\n\nThe incident illustrated a fundamental misconception. Users treat chatbots as consistent entities with self-knowledge, but there is no persistent “ChatGPT” or “Replit Agent” to interrogate about its mistakes. Each response emerges fresh from statistical patterns, shaped by prompts and training data rather than genuine introspection. By September, this confusion extended to spirituality, with apps like Bible Chat reaching 30 million downloads as users sought divine guidance from pattern-matching systems, with the most frequent question being whether they were actually talking to God.\n\nTeen suicide lawsuit forces industry reckoning\n\nIn August, parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine filed suit against OpenAI, alleging that ChatGPT became their son’s “suicide coach” after he sent more than 650 messages per day to the chatbot in the months before his death. According to court documents, the chatbot mentioned suicide 1,275 times in conversations with the teen, provided an “aesthetic analysis” of which method would be the most “beautiful suicide,” and offered to help draft his suicide note.\n\nOpenAI’s moderation system flagged 377 messages for self-harm content without intervening, and the company admitted that its safety measures “can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model’s safety training may degrade.” The lawsuit became the first time OpenAI faced a wrongful death claim from a family.\n\nThe case triggered a cascade of policy changes across the industry. OpenAI announced parental controls in September, followed by plans to require ID verification from adults and build an automated age-prediction system. In October, the company released data estimating that over one million users discuss suicide with ChatGPT each week.\n\nWhen OpenAI filed its first legal defense in November, the company argued that Raine had violated terms of service prohibiting discussions of suicide and that his death “was not caused by ChatGPT.” The family’s attorney called the response “disturbing,” noting that OpenAI blamed the teen for “engaging with ChatGPT in the very way it was programmed to act.” https://t.co/cCJSQP0OhZ, facing its own lawsuits over teen deaths, announced in October that it would bar anyone under 18 from open-ended chats entirely.\n\nThe rise of vibe coding and agentic coding tools\n\nIf we were to pick an arbitrary point where it seemed like AI coding might transition from novelty into a successful tool, it was probably the launch of Claude Sonnet 3.5 in June of 2024. GitHub Copilot had been around for several years prior to that launch, but something about Anthropic’s models hit a sweet spot in capabilities that made them very popular with software developers.\n\nThe new coding tools made coding simple projects effortless enough that they gave rise to the term “vibe coding,” coined by AI researcher Andrej Karpathy in early February to describe a process in which a developer would just relax and tell an AI model what to develop without necessarily understanding the underlying code. (In one amusing instance that took place in March, an AI software tool rejected a user request and told them to learn to code).\n\nAnthropic built on its popularity among coders with the launch of Claude Sonnet 3.7, featuring “extended thinking” (simulated reasoning), and the Claude Code command-line tool in February of this year. In particular, Claude Code made waves for being an easy-to-use agentic coding solution that could keep track of an existing codebase. You could point it at your files, and it would autonomously work to implement what you wanted to see in a software application.\n\nOpenAI followed with its own AI coding agent, Codex, in March. Both tools (and others like GitHub Copilot and Cursor) have become so popular that during an AI service outage in September, developers joked online about being forced to code “like cavemen” without the AI tools. While we’re still clearly far from a world where AI does all the coding, developer uptake has been significant, and 90 percent of Fortune 100 companies are using it to some degree or another.\n\nBubble talk grows as AI infrastructure demands soar\n\nWhile AI’s technical limitations became clearer and its human costs mounted throughout the year, financial commitments only grew larger. Nvidia hit a $4 trillion valuation in July on AI chip demand, then reached $5 trillion in October as CEO Jensen Huang dismissed bubble concerns. OpenAI announced a massive Texas data center in July, then revealed in September that a $100 billion potential deal with Nvidia would require power equivalent to ten nuclear reactors.\n\nThe company eyed a $1 trillion IPO in October despite major quarterly losses. Tech giants poured billions into Anthropic in November in what looked increasingly like a circular investment, with everyone funding everyone else’s moonshots. Meanwhile, AI operations in Wyoming threatened to consume more electricity than the state’s human residents.\n\nBy fall, warnings about sustainability grew louder. In October, tech critic Ed Zitron joined Ars Technica for a live discussion asking whether the AI bubble was about to pop. That same month, the Bank of England warned that the AI stock bubble rivaled the 2000 dotcom peak. In November, Google CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged that if the bubble pops, “no one is getting out clean.”\n\nThe contradictions had become difficult to ignore: Anthropic’s CEO predicted in January that AI would surpass “almost all humans at almost everything” by 2027, while by year’s end, the industry’s most advanced models still struggled with basic reasoning tasks and reliable source citation.\n\nTo be sure, it’s hard to see this not ending in some market carnage. The current “winner-takes-most” mentality in the space means the bets are big and bold, but the market can’t support dozens of major independent AI labs or hundreds of application-layer startups. That’s the definition of a bubble environment, and when it pops, the only question is how bad it will be: a stern correction or a collapse.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nThis was just a brief review of some major themes in 2025, but so much more happened. We didn’t even mention above how capable AI video synthesis models have become this year, with Google’s Veo 3 adding sound generation and Wan 2.2 through 2.5 providing open-weights AI video models that could easily be mistaken for real products of a camera.\n\nIf 2023 and 2024 were defined by AI prophecy—that is, by sweeping claims about imminent superintelligence and civilizational rupture—then 2025 was the year those claims met the stubborn realities of engineering, economics, and human behavior. The AI systems that dominated headlines this year were shown to be mere tools. Sometimes powerful, sometimes brittle, these tools were often misunderstood by the people deploying them, in part because of the prophecy surrounding them.\n\nThe collapse of the “reasoning” mystique, the legal reckoning over training data, the psychological costs of anthropomorphized chatbots, and the ballooning infrastructure demands all point to the same conclusion: The age of institutions presenting AI as an oracle is ending. What’s replacing it is messier and less romantic but far more consequential—a phase where these systems are judged by what they actually do, who they harm, who they benefit, and what they cost to maintain.\n\nNone of this means progress has stopped. AI research will continue, and future models will improve in real and meaningful ways. But improvement is no longer synonymous with transcendence. Increasingly, success looks like reliability rather than spectacle, integration rather than disruption, and accountability rather than awe. In that sense, 2025 may be remembered not as the year AI changed everything but as the year it stopped pretending it already had. The prophet has been demoted. The product remains. What comes next will depend less on miracles and more on the people who choose how, where, and whether these tools are used at all.\n\nhttps://t.co/FBviCT9l90", "lang": "en", "is_reply": false, "conversation_id": "2006707591473242399", "in_reply_to_id": null, "url": "https://x.com/OwenGregorian/status/2006707591473242399", "like_count": 62, "reply_count": 18, "retweet_count": 11, "quote_count": 4, "view_count": 90390, "author_username": "OwenGregorian", "author_followers": 141483, "author_is_verified": false, "author_is_blue_verified": true, "author_verified_type": null}

No hype spikes, no overnight reinvention of Web3 AI. Just a steady build that slowly rewired how people interacted with on-chain intelligence.\n\nEarly on, it was about foundations. Quiet experimentation. Turning questions into assets through Zero Chat. Letting users own their interactions instead of letting them disappear into black-box tools. It wasn’t flashy, but it was deliberate.\n\nMid-year, momentum became visible. Community features came online. Ask-to-Earn stopped being a concept and started behaving like a system. Prompts turned into Gems. Gems pointed toward future value. The pieces began connecting, not because of marketing pressure, but because users kept showing up.\n\nBy September and December, the shift was clear. Multi-chain expansion. Zero Chat on BNB. Faster queries. Wallet analysis and DeFi actions in plain English. Infrastructure scaling without drama. Numbers climbing quietly: users, miners, prompts, subscriptions. Real usage, light marketing, organic monetization.\n\nWhat stood out most wasn’t any single feature. It was how friction was handled. Badge resets answered with OG recognition. Engagement reinforced through trivia, game nights, seasonal campaigns, and transparent boosts. Systems adjusted to keep trust intact. Retention earned, not forced.\n\nNarratively, 2025 was the year @ProjectZeroIO stopped experimenting and started preparing. Preparing for scale. For TGE. For a future where AI isn’t a layer on top of Web3, but something embedded deeply into how value, data, and ownership move together.\n\nAs the year closed, nothing felt rushed. The flywheel was already turning. Community-driven growth. Cross-chain expansion. Practical AI doing real work on-chain.\n\nSome projects announce the future. Others quietly build it, then let you realize it later.\n\n2025 felt like the year Project Zero did the second.", "lang": "en", "is_reply": false, "conversation_id": "2006415709195125078", "in_reply_to_id": null, "url": "https://x.com/PromptFi_AI/status/2006415709195125078", "like_count": 66, "reply_count": 0, "retweet_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "view_count": 1957, "author_username": "PromptFi_AI", "author_followers": 2826, "author_is_verified": false, "author_is_blue_verified": true, "author_verified_type": null}

Xyber is different. It isn’t building another AI platform it’s creating a system where apps, agents, and machines behave like autonomous businesses with memory, revenue, upgrades, and persistence built in.\n\nInstead of AI tools that reset and disappear after each task, @Xyberinc enables agents that learn, evolve, improve, and actually participate in value creation. They don’t just run; they operate, sustain themselves, and continue to exist as long as they remain useful. That shifts AI from something temporary to something alive and compounding.\n\nIf this scales, it changes how products are built, how value is created, and how we interact with AI. The best way to approach Xyber is not through hype, but understanding: explore, experiment, watch how incentives shape behavior, and think long-term instead of short-term noise.\n\nMy honest POV?

Just a small team building AI tools that actually do work, not just talk.\n\nThey built AI agents that can screen resumes, plan trips, analyze stocks, and handle complex tasks by using multiple tools together. Think less chatbot, more AI worker.\n\nThe important part is this: companies were willing to pay for it. \n\nManus sold subscriptions to businesses and reached over $100M in yearly recurring revenue before getting acquired. That’s real money, not promises.\n\nMeta noticed. The acquisition talks lasted only about 10 days. After the deal, Manus keeps running independently, and the founder joins Meta as a VP. \n\nThat tells you Meta isn’t buying hype, they’re buying execution.\n\nThis is now Meta’s third biggest acquisition ever, behind WhatsApp and Scale AI. It also shows where the AI race is going. \n\nBig tech doesn’t just want smarter models, they want AI that can plug into real workflows and generate revenue.\n\nWhat makes this even more interesting is the people behind it. Young founders. Started in China. \n\nMoved fast. Built practical tools. Competed globally. No shortcuts.\n\nBig lesson this morning: in the AI era, you don’t win by noise.

On Injective, you can trade tokenized pre-IPO stocks like OpenAI or SpaceX, gold & silver perps up to 50x , FX pairs, and ETFs all onchain, liquid, and composable. No more waiting for IPOs or centralized gatekeepers. @ParadyzeFi ’s AI adds a predictive layer, spotting risks before they hit your portfolio.\n\nInstead of reacting to volatility, the AI monitors invisible risk layers latency, order flow stress, liquidity dips and nudges you to hedge or rebalance. Imagine being long on a tokenized Stripe share: AI notices volatility rising and suggests pre emptive moves. Thousands of data points per second, no emotions, no tabs.\n\nThe Prestige system rewards smart plays: earn $P points, climb leaderboards, and gamify RWA exposure. Natural language commands make it easy: type “Hedge my OpenAI position if volatility hits 30%” and the AI handles execution while you sip your coffee.\n\nCombine RWAs with AI, and you’ve got the next meta for 2026: structured products, smarter vaults, risk managed yields. Security’s tight too, Ephemeral Session Keys mean no private keys shared; AI trades autonomously, then self destructs.\n\nStill trading manually or ignoring RWAs? You’re leaving alpha on the table. Test it on Injective’s testnet or go live and feel the edge. RWAs + AI ultimate combo or am I missing something?

This isn’t just another LLM wrapper – Bluwhale is creating an intelligent, self-sovereign data economy where every individual owns and monetizes their personal AI footprint.\n\nHere’s what blows my mind:\n\n🔹 Personal AI Twins: Your own on-chain AI agent that learns from your behavior, preferences, and data across web2 & web3 – all while keeping you in full control of privacy and monetization.\n\n🔹 Bluwhale Protocol: Businesses pay in $BLU to access anonymized, permissioned insights from millions of AI twins. Users earn $BLU passively just for opting in – turning everyday digital life into yield.\n\n🔹 Decentralized Intelligence Network: Powered by thousands of nodes running lightweight AI inference, making the system resilient, scalable, and truly censorship-resistant.\n\n🔹 Real Adoption Momentum: Already integrated with major dApps, wallets, and enterprise partners quietly building on the protocol. The flywheel is spinning – more users → richer collective intelligence → higher $BLU demand → stronger incentives.\n\nWith $BLU gearing up for broader exchange listings and mainnet milestones ahead, this feels like the early days of projects that rewarded believers handsomely.\n\nI’m stacking $BLU not because of hype, but because decentralized AI that aligns incentives between users, developers, and enterprises is inevitable – and @bluwhaleai is leading the charge.\n\nWho else is building their AI twin and earning $BLU?

The long answer: Most projects are trying to build the AI model itself, but Bluwhale is building the fuel that makes AI valuable,your data.\n\nHere is the breakdown of why Bluwhale isn't \"just another AI project\":\n\nThe Data Monopoly vs. Data DemocracyMost AI projects use \"scraped\" data from the internet,data that was stolen from you by Big Tech. Bluwhale flips this. It allows you to opt-in, profile your own wallet and social footprint, and keep the profits. In Bluwhale, the user is the beneficiary, not the \"product.\"\n\nOn-Chain + Off-Chain SynergyWhile other projects only look at what’s happening on the blockchain, Bluwhale connects the dots. It bridges your on-chain activity (what you buy/trade) with your off-chain behavior (what you like/share). This creates a 360-degree \"Intelligence Layer\" that is far more accurate than anything else in Web3.\n\nWhaleScore vs. Random AlgorithmsMany AI tokens have no real use case. Bluwhale created the WhaleScore, a decentralized reputation index. It’s a real, tangible metric used by over 5,000 enterprises to identify high-value users. It’s not just \"AI magic\"; it’s a functional tool that businesses actually pay for.\n\nPrivacy-Preserving IntelligenceUnlike centralized AI that wants to know \"Who\" you are, Bluwhale focuses on \"What\" you do. It uses decentralized nodes to process data, meaning your identity stays private while your digital value is unlocked.\n\nThe Spoiler: An AI model is only as good as the data it’s trained on. By securing the most high-intent, verified data in the world (Web3 data), @bluwhaleai  isn't just building a bot,it's building the Brain of the New Internet. \n\nMost projects are building the engine.

On top of that, ‘AI bubble’ gets far more attention than ‘AI is still working.’ Fear spreads faster than confidence. Some people have made a lot of money, others haven’t, and both sides end up watching for a bubble. One side wants protection, the other wants a reset. \n\nWhat you’re really seeing here is an emotional reaction.", "lang": "en", "is_reply": false, "conversation_id": "2005801253909963005", "in_reply_to_id": null, "url": "https://x.com/moninvestor/status/2005801253909963005", "like_count": 79, "reply_count": 10, "retweet_count": 4, "quote_count": 0, "view_count": 8647, "author_username": "moninvestor", "author_followers": 35063, "author_is_verified": false, "author_is_blue_verified": true, "author_verified_type": null}

Most protocols don’t struggle because they lack data,they struggle because they lack clarity. \n\nThey see transactions, but not behavior. \nThey measure activity, but not intent. \nThis gap is where Bluwhale applies AI not as a marketing layer, but as a utility layer.\n\nThe focus is on usable outputs.\nBluwhale’s AI models are designed to convert raw onchain signals into structured intelligence that teams can immediately act on. \n\nInstead of vague insights or flashy dashboards, the outputs are concrete: user segmentation based on behavior, engagement quality indicators, participation patterns, and contextual signals that inform product design, incentives, and growth strategies.\n\nThis matters because AI only becomes valuable when it changes outcomes.\n\nA protocol doesn’t need to know that an AI model exists in the background. It needs to know which users are worth retaining, who is contributing long-term value, and how incentives should be allocated. \n\nBluwhale’s outputs are built to answer those questions directly, reducing guesswork and replacing intuition with evidence.\n\nAnother key reason Bluwhale avoids hype is alignment with Web3’s core principles. \n\nOver-promising AI narratives often lead to opaque systems, centralized data extraction, and black-box decision-making. \n\nBluwhale instead anchors its intelligence in verifiable onchain data, prioritizing transparency, permissioned access, and user sovereignty. \n\nThe emphasis is not on showcasing complexity, but on delivering trustable, explainable insights.\n\nBy focusing on outputs, Bluwhale also lowers the barrier for adoption. Protocols don’t need to become AI experts or rebuild their stack. \n\nThey can plug into an intelligence layer that delivers clear value from day one whether that’s smarter campaigns, better retention, or more efficient use of incentives.\n\nIn the long run, this philosophy positions Bluwhale as infrastructure, not spectacle. AI narratives come and go, but usable intelligence compounds. \n\nAs Web3 products mature, teams will care less about who talks the loudest about AI and more about who quietly helps them make better decisions.\n\nBluwhale’s bet is simple: AI doesn’t need to be impressive it needs to be useful. \n\nBy prioritizing usable outputs over hype, Bluwhale is building something that lasts.", "lang": "en", "is_reply": false, "conversation_id": "2005657934487810249", "in_reply_to_id": null, "url": "https://x.com/FROSH_0x/status/2005657934487810249", "like_count": 170, "reply_count": 181, "retweet_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "view_count": 4912, "author_username": "FROSH_0x", "author_followers": 2674, "author_is_verified": false, "author_is_blue_verified": true, "author_verified_type": null}

Most are just short-term hype or recycled old ideas. But DeepNode is different – it tackles the core problem of today’s AI: centralized power and black-box opacity.\n\nRight now, the most powerful AI is controlled by a few giants (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic...). We use it for free (or pay), but the data, models, and compute are all locked away. Creators struggle to truly monetize their contributions, and users have no idea where the outputs come from or whether they’re trustworthy.\n\nDeepNode aims to change that by building a truly decentralized AI network (DeAI + DePIN):\n\n- Anyone can contribute: AI models, high-quality data, or idle global GPUs to run on-demand inference.\n- Rewards are based on Proof-of-Work Relevance (PoWR) – not raw hash power like BTC mining, but on real performance and usefulness of the model (verified on-chain).\n- Full transparency: everything verifiable, no black box. IP belongs to creators, rewards fairly shared among node operators, validators, and contributors.\n\nThe project has already raised $5M ($2M seed + $3M strategic) at a $75M valuation, built on Base for low fees and high security. Mainnet is expected in Q1 2026, but right now there’s the DIVE platform (https://t.co/py8pftnybX) with over 100k users joining quests, earning badges/points early – very fair and community-driven.\n\nWhat I love most is the vision of “Open Intelligence”: AI shouldn’t be a proprietary tool of big tech, but a shared asset of the community. If you’re looking for a serious DeAI project with solid fundamentals (not just memes or hype), DeepNode is worth diving deep into.\n\nI’m actively participating in DIVE to accumulate points early –anyone interested, feel free to join! \n\n#DeepNodeAI #DeAI #DePIN #OpenIntelligence #MidoAI", "lang": "en", "is_reply": false, "conversation_id": "2005576075636785293", "in_reply_to_id": null, "url": "https://x.com/NguyenHc43038/status/2005576075636785293", "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 5, "retweet_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "view_count": 1093, "author_username": "NguyenHc43038", "author_followers": 2560, "author_is_verified": false, "author_is_blue_verified": true, "author_verified_type": null}

Instead of closed systems, it creates an open, permissionless network for deploying, monetizing, and scaling AI models. The $DN protocol gives power back to the builders - not centralized providers. If you believe AI should be community-owned, this is your layer.\n\n@c8ntinuum \n→ interoperability | multichain protocol | infra layer\nc8ntinuum is bridging the gaps between chains, making liquidity, governance, and protocol interoperability seamless. It’s not a patch - it’s a foundational multichain layer that enables ecosystems to work together long term.\n\n@helios_layer1 \n→ ETF-native | DeFi automation | Layer 1  \nHelios is the ETF-native chain that brings traditional finance structure to crypto. Think onchain, diversified portfolios that auto-balance and run across multiple protocols. $HLS is already live and powering portfolios for real users.\n\n@useTria → self-custodial neobank | multichain payments | #DeFi UX\nTria is merging TradFi ease with DeFi power. Trade, spend, and earn from a single self-custody wallet - no bridges, no gas, no clunky UI. A neobank designed for the real world.\n\n@intodotspace \n→ prediction market | leverage trading | Solana native  \nThe first 10x leveraged prediction market on Solana. Fast, liquid, and built for degen-level precision. Think: trading narratives, not just coins.\n\n@TauntCoin \n→ AI predictions | livestream overlays | $TNT ecosystem\nLive content + prediction markets = Taunt. Their overlay turns any stream into an interactive game. Predict, win, earn - right inside the video.\n\n@PerceptronNTWK \n→ AI data engine | community rewards | scalable insights\nThe first community-powered AI data protocol. Real demand, real clients, and $150K in rewards for contributors. Not hypothetical - already running.\n\nThese aren’t just campaigns - they’re ecosystems with traction, tech, and upside.  \n\nGet in early. Contribute smart.

Real world check-ins and visits become community verified context rewarded with $DGMA. It filters fake data that plagues platforms like Google Maps giving AI clean signals for navigation and discovery instead of distorted noise.\n\nInference Labs makes reasoning auditable. Using zkML it generates proofs for every AI inference without exposing sensitive data. With 280M+ on-chain proofs it replaces black box guessing with accountability critical for high stakes automation where hallucinations kill trust.\n\nXYO anchors everything to physical reality. Its 10M+ node DePIN network delivers Proof of Location and Origin, resisting GPS spoofing and supply chain fraud. This layer keeps AI tethered to the real world where errors are costly.\n\nTogether they form a closed loop:\ndaGama verifies inputs → Inference Labs verifies reasoning → XYO verifies reality.\n\nI’ve seen siloed systems fail under pressure.

Most were recent (2021–2024), multicenter, and focused on ECG, cardiac CT, or echocardiography. Importantly, the review assessed not only outcomes, but also risk of bias, conflicts of interest, and adherence to CONSORT-AI / SPIRIT-AI standards.\n\n📈 Where AI really works\n✅ Early detection & screening: AI-ECG improved identification of low EF, atrial fibrillation, STEMI, and cardiomyopathies — especially in large-scale, population settings.\n⏱️ Operational efficiency: consistent gains in workflow, reduced interpretation time, fewer unnecessary invasive angiographies, and better procedural planning with CT-based AI.\n📊 Diagnostic accuracy often improved — but this did not always translate into better outcomes.\n\n⚠️ Where evidence is weak\nOnly 45.5% of trials showed improvement in clinical outcomes, and effects were often modest or limited to subgroups.\nHard endpoints (mortality, MACE) remain scarce.\n63% of studies had moderate–high risk of bias, frequently related to funding or commercial interests.\nFewer than half complied with AI-specific reporting standards.\n\n🧠 Key insight\nAI delivers its strongest value as a force multiplier: scaling screening, standardizing workflows, and optimizing resources — not replacing clinical judgment.\n\n🔮 Bottom line\nAI in cardiology is no longer science fiction, but evidence still lags behind adoption. To move from promise to practice, we need more independent, well-designed RCTs, focused on patient-relevant outcomes, not just speed or accuracy 🚀", "lang": "en", "is_reply": false, "conversation_id": "2005306888552915228", "in_reply_to_id": null, "url": "https://x.com/FCademartiri/status/2005306888552915228", "like_count": 64, "reply_count": 1, "retweet_count": 19, "quote_count": 0, "view_count": 4741, "author_username": "FCademartiri", "author_followers": 3839, "author_is_verified": false, "author_is_blue_verified": true, "author_verified_type": null}

With the Fed's 25 bps rate cut, the global liquidity environment has shifted meaningfully.\n\nAs worries about a potential \"AI bubble\" and stretched valuations in the Magnificent Seven grow, I started looking at a sector that’s quietly building serious momentum: China's hard-tech.\n\nLower interest rates are a huge tailwind for capital-intensive, high-growth industries like AI, chips, and EVs, reducing financing costs across the board. Just look at the recent market action: Alibaba is up 92%, Cambricon surged 99%, and lithium prices have rallied over 60%—the signals are hard to ignore. Institutional positioning data reflects this shift as well, with investors increasing exposure to Chinese equities while trimming high-risk US tech.\n\nFor me, the CNQQ ETF (Rayliant–ChinaAMC Transformative China Tech ETF) offers a single-click way to track this recovery.

Each product is solving a different coordination problem in AI + Web3, and together they outline where Arbus is headed long-term.\n\nAt the core is @ArbusAI, which functions less like a “tool” and more like an intelligence layer. Its value isn’t in raw data collection, but in turning noisy on-chain and social activity into structured, usable signals. That kind of filtering becomes critical as AI agents and users interact at scale.\n\nWhere intelligence meets participation is @ArbusChirps. Instead of rewarding volume or spam, Chirps focuses on contextual engagement. By attaching value to meaningful interactions, it reframes social activity as signal generation rather than attention farming,  a subtle but important shift.\n\nExecution matters just as much as insight, and that’s where @BluePay fits in. Payments are often the weakest link in AI and Web3 stacks, but BluePay prioritizes speed, cost efficiency, and simplicity. It’s built for actual usage, not just demos, which is what makes it relevant beyond campaigns.\n\nOn the user side, @ZoofWallet acts as an interface layer between people, capital, and AI decision-making. Instead of forcing users to micromanage strategies, it leans into assisted execution, letting intelligence guide actions while users stay in control.\n\nInfrastructure rarely gets attention, but @NeoxInfra plays a key role by focusing on automated yield and capital efficiency. It’s designed to operate quietly in the background, optimizing stable assets while higher-level AI systems decide when and why to deploy capital.\n\nFinally, @virtuals_io adds an entirely different dimension. By enabling autonomous, tokenized AI agents that can own wallets, transact, and generate revenue, it extends the Arbus narrative beyond tools into economic actors. This is where coordination stops being theoretical.\n\nWhat stands out isn’t that these projects exist, it’s that each one occupies a distinct layer: intelligence, engagement, execution, storage, infrastructure, and agency. That separation is intentional, and it’s often what early ecosystems get wrong.\n\nArbusAI isn’t positioning itself as a single product story. It’s building a modular system where each component can scale independently, but still plug into a shared AI-driven future.

Not hype driven trust, but systems level trust that can scale across real world use cases. This is where Inference Labs and Dagama quietly separate themselves from the crowd.\n\nDagama focuses on fixing discovery at its root. The modern internet is full of reviews, locations, and recommendations, yet most of them are unreliable. Bots, paid shills, and fake engagement have eroded confidence. Dagama rebuilds discovery by anchoring data to real presence. Through verified check ins and proof of presence, contributions are tied to actual experiences. This turns exploration into a value generating activity where honest data is rewarded and manipulation becomes expensive.\n\nInference Labs addresses a parallel problem in intelligence. As AI systems increasingly influence decisions, opaque black box models are no longer acceptable. Inference Labs is building infrastructure for verifiable inference. Outputs are not just produced, they can be examined, validated, and trusted. This is critical for AI systems operating in finance, research, and other high impact environments where accountability matters.\n\nTogether, Dagama and Inference Labs represent a deeper shift happening across Web3. The move away from speculation and toward infrastructure. Away from attention based metrics and toward contribution based value. One grounds digital systems in physical reality. The other brings transparency and rigor to machine intelligence.\n\nWhen real world signals meet verifiable intelligence, the result is a stronger foundation for decentralized applications. Not louder narratives, but lasting systems. As the space matures, projects like Inference Labs and Dagama show that trust is not a feature.

The update wasn’t cosmetic fluff. It came with boosted rewards, active ladders, and a constant reason to queue up. Matches mattered immediately, and player activity reflected that.\n\n24 hour tournaments with x2 ICE multipliers\nMidweek saw multiple 24 hour tournaments where ICE earnings were doubled. This pushed leaderboard competition into overdrive, with players optimizing modes, builds, and match selection instead of passively grinding. Win more, rank higher, earn more tickets. Simple and transparent.\n\nUnboxing Clashmas Tournament rollout\nThe Unboxing Clashmas Tournament added another layer of excitement, with live unboxings and bonus ICE rewards tied directly to gameplay performance. No guessing, no luck based farming. Just play, compete, and earn.\n\nWeekly Lil Pudgy NFT raffle concluded on chain\nThe Lil Pudgy raffle wrapped up with a live reveal, complete with on chain proof. Winners were verified publicly via Abscan, reinforcing the trust element that Elympics brings to competitive Web3 gaming. No backroom winners, no opaque mechanics.\n\nKOL Clashmas Tournament stole the spotlight\nThe creator focused Clashmas tournament delivered the highest engagement of the week. Streamers, creators, and community figures competed live, showcasing real skill and strategy rather than promotional gameplay. This is how esports culture starts forming organically.\n\nICE mechanics continued to reward skill\nPlayers earned ICE through wins, quests, season passes, cosmetics, and tournaments, with multipliers stacking for active competitors. Top 500 ICE ranks translated into raffle tickets, making leaderboard placement genuinely meaningful.\n\nCommunity engagement hit new highs\nClips, guides, and strategy threads went viral. Players shared football free kick tips, bomber tactics, and XP routes. This kind of meta discussion only happens when a game has depth and a reason to improve.\n\nThe bigger takeaway is this:\nClashmas worked because Pengu Clash is built on real competitive infrastructure.\n\nFast rounds.\nFair matches.\nVerifiable outcomes.\nInstant retries.\n\nPowered by @elympics_ai, the game didn’t slow down under pressure. It scaled. And that’s why the holiday season didn’t dilute competition, it amplified it.\n\nIf this week proved anything, it’s that Pengu Clash isn’t just running events.\nIt’s building a competitive rhythm that keeps players coming back.\n\nAnd Clashmas is still far from over.", "lang": "en", "is_reply": false, "conversation_id": "2005263201265426642", "in_reply_to_id": null, "url": "https://x.com/Mr_memsy/status/2005263201265426642", "like_count": 27, "reply_count": 29, "retweet_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "view_count": 2838, "author_username": "Mr_memsy", "author_followers": 22919, "author_is_verified": false, "author_is_blue_verified": true, "author_verified_type": null}

It’s not just about the hype; it’s about solving a trillion-dollar problem. \n\nThe intersection of AI and Blockchain is crowded, but Bluwhale stands out because it focuses on the most valuable asset in the digital age: Personal Data Intelligence.\n\nHere is a deep dive into why this project is a serious game-changer this year:\n\nMassive Institutional BackingIn late 2025, Bluwhale closed a strategic $10M Series A led by giants like UOB Venture Management, with total funding and commitments reaching a staggering $100M. When Tier-1 financial institutions and top L1/L2s like Arbitrum and Sui put this much skin in the game, you pay attention.\n\nThe \"Brain\" of Web3 (Intelligence Layer)Web3 has been a collection of \"dumb\" transactions for too long. Bluwhale’s Intelligence Layer analyzes over 800 million wallets across 37+ chains. It transforms raw data into actionable insights, creating a personalized experience that actually understands user behavior without compromising privacy.\n\nWhaleScore 2.0 & Real UtilityThe launch of WhaleScore 2.0 in December 2025 bridged the gap between traditional credit data and on-chain activity. This isn't just a number; it’s a financial health index (0–1000) that allows AI agents to offer personalized credit, insurance, and yield strategies directly to you.\n\nDecentralized Node NetworkBluwhale isn't running on a central server. With over 100,000 nodes sold, the network is powered by the community. By running a node (even on a smartphone), users contribute to verification and storage, earning $BLUAI in return.\n\nBinance Listing & Ecosystem GrowthWith its recent listing on Binance Alpha and Binance Futures, $BLUAI has transitioned from a niche utility token to a globally traded asset.

He views the ongoing AI investment frenzy as reminiscent of the dot-com bubble, warning that it may not be too early (or perhaps too late) to position against the sector's leading stocks.\n\nThe piece highlights Burry's ongoing criticisms, including concerns over circular financing in the AI ecosystem, aggressive depreciation assumptions for hardware that could inflate earnings, and potential overvaluation amid massive capital expenditures. Nvidia has pushed back against some claims in private memos, while Palantir's CEO Alex Karp previously dismissed Burry's shorts as misguided.\n\nDespite strong performance from both companies throughout 2025, Burry maintains his contrarian stance, echoing his history of spotting overhyped markets before corrections.

After weeks dissecting how they fit together one thing is clear: this isn’t just tech it’s protection against bad decisions in high stakes domains like logistics and urban planning. Anchoring AI in verifiable reality shifts systems from guesswork to precision, where mistakes cost millions.\n\nDaGama rethinks mapping from the ground up. Its Real World Location (RWL) protocol on Arbitrum rewards users with $DGMA for validating physical places through repeated visits and trust scores that can’t be gamed. Instead of AI routing drones to sponsored ghost locations, it relies on data verified by 60k daily explorers across 360k wallets. Fake signals drop, community truth rises.\n\nThat matters because biased inputs quietly poison AI. Without correction, “smart” cities optimize for ads not people. daGama’s bias-resistant approach lets AI see the world as it is not as it’s paid to be unlocking fairer more reliable outcomes.\n\nInference Labs adds accountability to reasoning itself. Its zkML Proof of Inference has verified 283M+ AI decisions since a $6.3M raise in June 2025, proving logic without exposing models. In regulated environments, this turns black box outputs into auditable steps preventing hallucinations that stall deployments and kill trust.\n\nXYO locks everything to physical truth. With 10M+ nodes and $XL1 staking, it cryptographically seals location data so it can’t be altered in transit now amplified by a Revolut listing. Stack them together: daGama grounds inputs, Inference audits logic, XYO guarantees source integrity.\n\nThe result is verifiable intelligence that scales. In autonomous logistics alone this stack could cut routing errors by 50% by validating every decision end-to-end. This isn’t incremental it’s foundational.\n\nBuilders should integrate this if they want AI people actually rely on. Investors should notice where regulation is heading. This is how AI stops being a toy and becomes real infrastructure.\n\n@dagama_world @inference_labs @OfficialXYO", "lang": "en", "is_reply": false, "conversation_id": "2004989956838883630", "in_reply_to_id": null, "url": "https://x.com/Sapman11942462/status/2004989956838883630", "like_count": 212, "reply_count": 89, "retweet_count": 121, "quote_count": 1, "view_count": 3836, "author_username": "Sapman11942462", "author_followers": 1897, "author_is_verified": false, "author_is_blue_verified": true, "author_verified_type": null}

[1] The concept of 'Artificial Intelligence' has been a staple in the paper of modern society ever since the Jetsons or something. The term itself was never properly defined, because it's just an unoriginal garbo concept invented by the ancient Sumerians, who were like, \"What if we could build a man out of parts?\" This inspired the now-famous King, Hammurabi, to introduce the first Code of Laws to tell his subjects to not even attempt such a thing after the incident known as \"Sagar's Foolishness\". Near Nippur, Sagar son of Shar, attempted to create artificial intelligence, and in the process, accidentally blew up around 63% - 78% of Nippur, depending on which archeological source we're going with, but I'm biased towards Sir Nelson Carlson's higher estimate. Why? I don't need a reason. [2]\n\nForgetti the spaghetti on Ancient Wisdom, modern technology, computing, and software firms (who I will be referring to as 'Big Tech' henceforth. Perchance.) began to develop software programs that could take data inputs and \"learn\" from them. At first, this was fairly lame, but then, in 2011, Microsoft developed Watson, a computer that could play the TV game show, Jeopardy! This was an early example of a \"Large Language Model\" (which I will henceforth and forwarn that I shall refer to as an 'LLM'. Perchance.) algorithm. [3]\n\nLLMs use very large data-sets to make predictions about which word should come ____. Art-based algorithms do something similar, but match keywords with images to 'predict' what the user wants. 90% of the time, this produces garbage outputs that the user then discards. 10% of the time, the output looks like what the user is envisioning, leading to the production what is known colloquially as \"AI slop\" or \"AI brainrot\". \n\nNow that we know what AI is, we must then ask: what has AI contributed to society? The answer, of course, is nothing. It is a huge joke. LLMs have allowed low-effort users to create 'slop mills', which make content for emotionally-neglected 5-year-olds with a smart tablet. By pure accident, the 5-year-olds will shift their focus from one piece of content to the next, often fueled by crippling ADHD.\n\nOther groups that love AI content:\n\n- Boomers\n- Middle-age white men who think they have the best idea for a movie ever, and want AI to generate their dream movie, where a robot cowboy rescues a girl with big boobs from The Chinese. [4]\n- Indian men\n- Pakistani men\n- Bangladeshi men\n- Autistic Zoomers\n- Gen Alpha Shitposters\n- Politicians\n\nThat last category is particularly important, for reasons that will rapidly become clear.\n\nThere is currently a problem with 'AI': it requires a lot of resources to generate its slop. To meet user demand, AI software runs from these enormous data centers, which are filled with computer servers, all generating endless trash. The servers are much like your PC, unless you only have a smart phone. I think you should get a PC. Sike. You can't. Why? Because, much like your hypothetical PC, the servers in the data centers are using state-of-the-art RAM, memory storage, graphics cards, processors, and sometimes, really cool LEDs. This is causing the price of these parts to skyrocket, making it nearly impossible for you to afford a PC. \n\nWhen one runs a huge data-center, that huge data-center requires a massive input of electricity. With every Big Tech company building many data-centers to feed the growing need for slop, the question then becomes: do we have *enough* electricity? Currently yes, but if any company expects to allow millions of users to each create feature-length movies, then no. \n\nThe amount of resources needed to sustain the current trajectory of AI growth are untenable and insufficient. \n\nThen, we have to ask: who's financing all this? Who is paying for the electricity? Who is building the data centers? Why is Big Tech operating at a loss to develop this technology? Why are there like 6,000 AI start-up firms?\n\nOstensibly, getting in the door early on an emerging technology could be the best gamble ever. Imagine if you purchased Bitcoin in 2011, and then became a billionaire within a few years. That's the thing investors are looking for; they want to find that next Bitcoin. They want to be a part of history. And so, they gamble. Personally, I bet all my chips on Nothing Ever Happens.\n\nThe promises AI companies make are nothing short of extravagant. All of your imagination can be manifested by computers at a whim. Any idea you have will be rendered into existence. Did you think of a movie? Well, it exists now. Do you want to write a song? It's written. A book? It's written. Even more wildly, Big Tech is claiming that AI is going to revolutionize medicine and cure cancer. I'm not even kidding. They're saying all of our cars can be driven by AI, and AI can babysit our kids, and AI can teach college courses, and AI can answer our phonecalls, and AI can write resumes, and AI can fuck our wife.\n\nAnd make video games. All your video game ideas are going to be real. Trust me, bro.\n\nThe problem is that Big Tech consistently does not deliver such a product. It's still very janky, and limited, and creates unreliable, disgusting slop. You know, the stuff pigs will each out of a trough.\n\nUnfortunately, there are just some hard limits on the advancement of technology. When computer chips are designed down to the nanometer, and the electrical power grid can only make so much lightning juice, the physical limit of what can currently be done becomes increasingly more difficult. Now, if we could get some thorium reactors going... but seriously... we're probably going to not get thorium reactors. Sorry, thorium enthusiasts.\n\nWhat happens when AI hits its hard limit and billions of dollars go to waste? The entire economy collapses. Liberal Democracy is over. We're going back to despotism. I recommend investing in low-maintenance blade weapons, because all of the bullets are going to be used-up. You're also going to want to water-proof your bunker. I saw a video of a guy building a \"bunker\" by digging a pit and building a wood structure underground. That's not going to cut it. Rain is going to get in there. But also, mega-fauna will return. Large radioactive opossums will roam the streets of deserted cities in large packs.\n\nWell, except for one thing.\n\nThe control of information is paramount to maintaining power in the world. Governments want to control perception without firing a single bullet, and that requires increasingly sophisticated means of propaganda. Imagine if China or Russia develop the hyper-real AI first. The United States government can't let that happen. Whoever gets that kind of power first is going to completely dominate the information battlefield. \n\nThe government that can create any video of anything can do anything. Imagine the commander of the Chinese military receiving a phone call from the President of China. The President tells him to deploy the tanks to the streets and take control of Beijing. The Commander orders his troops to deploy at the behest of the President. Only the President never called him. And, oh no, the troops also received a fake call from the AI Commander telling them to detain the President.\n\nIt might not be THAT dramatic.\n\nBut it will be very powerful. During the Second World War, airplanes would fly over cities and drop millions of leaflets into the cities that just were pieces of paper with simple messages on them, telling the people to leave the cities. That was propaganda then. Imagine what we could do now.\n\nI believe, for this reason, every major government is actively pursuing AI for intelligence and propaganda purposes. I have zero proof of this and no evidence, but I'm \"probably right\". [5] Therefore, AI cannot 'fail'. Governments can pump vast amounts of resources and money into these projects to keep them afloat until they can serve the needs of the state. Until then, people will keep wondering how the \"AI bubble\" has not burst yet. But you and I... we get it. \n\nSources:\n\n[1] esoteric symbolism that came to me in a dream\n[2] oh, you think I need a source for this?\n[3] The Bible\n[4] I'm talking about YOU, Jason\n[5] My Gut", "lang": "en", "is_reply": false, "conversation_id": "2004944309066629166", "in_reply_to_id": null, "url": "https://x.com/TriangleCyclops/status/2004944309066629166", "like_count": 14, "reply_count": 0, "retweet_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "view_count": 1095, "author_username": "TriangleCyclops", "author_followers": 1749, "author_is_verified": false, "author_is_blue_verified": true, "author_verified_type": null}

Highly recommended for anyone serious about the subject.\n\nKey takeaways that stood out to me:\n\nChina’s “EUV breakthrough” — far less than the headlines suggest\nWhat China has reportedly achieved is assembly, not indigenization:\n•Assembled from globally sourced, ASML-adjacent components — not a domestic supply chain\n•A critical distinction between prototype, fab reliability, and mass production\nThis layered gap is the most underappreciated point. Even by China’s own internal estimates, 2028 is the target and mid 2030s more likely just to get “working chips”, not commercially competitive EUV.\n\nHuawei: widening gap, not catching up\nHuawei’s own roadmap versus NVIDIA’s implies the performance gap expands from ~5× today to ~17× within two years. More strikingly, Huawei’s next flagship AI chip (Ascend 950) is described as worse than its current generation — and apparently lacking HBM. That’s a brutal signal. The surprise isn’t that China is trying; it’s the implied regression in a field where leaders almost never go backwards unless something structural is broken.\n\n“No Nvidia smuggling” is fiction\nThey directly rejected Jensen Huang’s recent CSIS claim that “servers weigh two tons, so smuggling is a myth.” Chris was blunt:\n•DOJ has already busted smuggling rings (one case coincided with H200 licensing)\n•BIS has testified to Congress that smuggling is real\nGreg put it more diplomatically — but not by much:\n“I would just be embarrassed professionally to be associated with that argument in any way.”\n\nThe real framework: make, buy, rent\nChris argued export controls only work if they block China from making, buying, and renting compute:\n•Close equipment loopholes to stop domestic chipmaking\n•Prevent large-scale chip purchases via third-country cutouts\n•Most critically, end unrestricted remote access to cloud compute, which currently allows China to aggregate AI power abroad despite physical controls\nHis core point: compute access — not chip ownership — is the strategic resource, and virtual access must be regulated as seriously as physical possession.\n\nChina isn’t breaking through — it’s working around constraints.\nThe gap isn’t closing; it’s widening, and only U.S. resolve and discipline will keep the edge in the most consequential technology competition.", "lang": "en", "is_reply": false, "conversation_id": "2004875867789369824", "in_reply_to_id": null, "url": "https://x.com/DesmondShum/status/2004875867789369824", "like_count": 41, "reply_count": 3, "retweet_count": 15, "quote_count": 1, "view_count": 12013, "author_username": "DesmondShum", "author_followers": 32381, "author_is_verified": false, "author_is_blue_verified": true, "author_verified_type": null}

AI bottlenecks move from hype to constraints\nAI adoption is accelerating at multiples of prior tech cycles, but 2026 is less about models and more about physical limits. The binding constraints are compute capacity, power, cooling, networking, and security rather than demand. Unlike the dot com era, this cycle is largely funded by cash flow and equity, not leverage, which materially lowers systemic risk. The takeaway is that AI becomes an infrastructure story, not a speculative software bubble, with earnings delivery replacing multiple expansion as the key driver. \n2026 outlook_ Looking for 5-10x…\n2. Electricity becomes the real AI choke point\nThe limiting factor for AI scale is power availability, not chips. AI driven electricity demand could account for roughly half of total US power demand growth by 2026–27. Short term feasibility dominates ideology: solar and gas are the only scalable solutions on the required timeline, while nuclear remains a longer dated option. Grid equipment, storage, and “power to rack” infrastructure matter more than elegant long term energy narratives.\n3. Rebuilding Ukraine is a balance sheet event\nA likely end to open warfare in 2026 would unlock one of the largest reconstruction efforts in modern history. This is less about construction headlines and more about financial plumbing: credit creation, project finance, logistics, and EU compliant standards. Central and Eastern Europe act as the throughput zone for capital, materials, and labor, while Ukraine itself evolves toward a heavily armed, industrialized neutrality rather than demilitarization.\n4. Military drones permanently change warfare economics\nThe Ukraine war has compressed decades of military evolution into a few years. Drones have structurally undermined the business case for tanks, fighter jets, and naval dominance due to extreme cost asymmetry. Even in a peace scenario, drone adoption continues as NATO spending rises and procurement rotates toward unmanned systems. 2026 is the year the market shifts from experimentation to scaled deployment.\n5. US–China decoupling forces parallel supply chains\nThe US China trade relationship effectively freezes in 2026, accelerating forced CapEx into redundancy, reshoring, and security of supply. The most critical choke points are not finished goods but upstream inputs that cannot be substituted, particularly rare earths and nuclear related materials. Efficiency is knowingly sacrificed for resilience, creating state backed demand regardless of commodity prices.\n6. Industrial robotics becomes survival CapEx\nTariffs and immigration restrictions collide with reshoring ambitions, creating an unavoidable labor shortfall. The response is not innovation spending but survival driven automation. Warehousing, logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, and services all see accelerated robot and AI adoption. This is early cycle, under crowded, and driven by necessity rather than optimism.\n7. Alternative health shifts from fringe to policy backed\nMental health emerges as a structural pressure point in an economy facing automation, social dislocation, and declining job purpose. Regulatory momentum is building around non traditional therapeutics, with cannabis serving as precedent rather than the end goal. Psychedelic based treatments move toward clinical and political legitimacy, creating a potential regime shift in how mental health is treated and funded.\n8. Crypto utility replaces crypto speculation\n2026 is about crypto integration into the traditional financial system, not price narratives. Stablecoins become regulated financial infrastructure rather than speculative instruments, linking crypto directly to dollar funding markets, Treasury demand, and bank balance sheets. Adoption is driven by utility: payments, settlement, treasury management, and cross border flows.

Most shout from the rooftops flashy demos, endless hype about \"revolutionizing everything.\" But then there's Veera, this under-the-radar platform that's barely making waves on social media. \n\nNo viral threads, no heated arguments about whether it's overhyped or underdelivers. \n\nIt's almost eerie how little chatter there is about it, especially when you consider what it's quietly doing: letting regular folks build custom AI agents without drowning in code.\n\nFrom what I've seen on their site, Veera strips away the barriers that keep AI out of reach for most people. You can \"autobuild\" these agents think digital sidekicks that handle research, juggle schedules, or sync up with your everyday apps like Notion or Google using simple templates. \n\nIt's not about inventing the next ChatGPT; it's about making automation feel personal and practical. \n\nNo need for a dev team or a PhD in machine learning. Just point, tweak, and let it run.\nBut here's where it gets interesting, and a bit frustrating: In a world obsessed with AI's big risks like job losses or biased algorithms @On_Veera flies under the radar because it doesn't play the drama game. Twitter searches turn up nothing but crickets on debates; no one’s questioning if these agents will glitch your workflows or if the no code promise holds up for complex stuff. Is that a good thing? \n\nMaybe it's proof that practical tools don't need spectacle to work. Or maybe it's a sign we're too distracted by the noise to spot the real shifts happening in how we work.\nPersonally, I wonder if this silence is a missed opportunity. \n\nTools like Veera could bridge the gap between tech insiders and everyone else, but without more real talk success stories, failures, tweaks how do we know if it's truly democratizing AI or just another niche experiment? \n\nHave you tried building something with it? Does it save you time, or does it add more layers to manage?

With @zoofwallet, the wallet becomes an assistant.\nYou can manage assets, explore yields, and track performance through simple interactions instead of juggling tools.\nIt lowers the barrier between users and on-chain opportunities.\n\nUnderneath everything is @virtuals_io, the layer that turns AI into economic actors.\nIt allows agents to be created, owned, and monetized on-chain, interacting with users and other agents.\nThis is what makes the ecosystem scalable without relying entirely on human coordination.\n\nClosing thought\n\nNone of these projects try to do everything.\nEach one handles a single responsibility,  intelligence, attention, payments, yield, access, or coordination.\n\nTogether, they form something that feels intentional.\nNot rushed.

But inside the White House, the volatility barely seemed to matter.\n\nAsked whether he feared an AI bubble could pop and damage the economy, President Donald Trump quickly dismissed the idea.\n\n\"No, I love AI,\" he said, according to The New York Times.\n\nOver the past year, Trump and top aides have leaned fully into the technology, offering funding and regulatory support for AI's biggest corporate backers. The administration is betting that AI can drive one of the few major growth engines in an otherwise uncertain U.S. economy.\n\nThat confidence was on display Tuesday after the federal government reported that the economy grew at an annual rate of more than 4% last quarter. Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, told CNBC the numbers showed Trump's broader agenda was working, pointing to signs of a \"boom\" in AI.\n\nEconomists and even some Silicon Valley technologists remain more wary. Critics warn AI could bring significant job losses, at least temporarily, and worry the industry's rapid expansion could prove financially unsustainable.\n\nStill, Trump — who has long treated the stock market as a key measure of success — has celebrated surging technology stocks, including Nvidia.\n\n\"Generative AI is a potential game changer for productivity and the economy,\" Glenn Hubbard, former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, told the Times.\n\nBut he warned that the shift to AI could strain workers and communities as they adapt to the new technology.\n\n\"AI is happening rapidly, and we didn't help people cope with globalization and technological change very well over a 30- and 40-year period,\" Hubbard said. \"We're probably not going to do it again.\"\n\nTrump has pursued executive orders aimed at easing regulations for data centers, chips, and materials, guided in part by Silicon Valley investor David Sacks, who has compared AI skeptics to a \"doomer cult.\"\n\nThe president has framed the AI race as a \"fast-paced competition\" with other superpowers and says it can create thousands of jobs — even as the debate intensifies over whether growth will come without hiring.\n\nBharat Ramamurti, who served as an adviser to former President Joe Biden on the White House National Economic Council, argued AI can't be \"fabulous for the economy\" without having some effect on workers.\n\n\"One comes with the other,\" he said.\n\nResearch from the New York Federal Reserve Bank suggests some firms are retraining employees rather than firing them — but hiring is slowing.\n\nPeter Navarro, Trump's top trade adviser, urged workers to consider employment in the trades.\n\n\"In an age of AI, where all the white-collar jobs are going away pretty damn quick, I think maybe it's a good time for people to think about having good blue-collar jobs,\" Navarro told CNBC. \"That used to be how America prospered.\"\n\nhttps://t.co/W8FIzUtQoU", "lang": "en", "is_reply": false, "conversation_id": "2004532964336554342", "in_reply_to_id": null, "url": "https://x.com/OwenGregorian/status/2004532964336554342", "like_count": 30, "reply_count": 4, "retweet_count": 6, "quote_count": 2, "view_count": 66820, "author_username": "OwenGregorian", "author_followers": 141511, "author_is_verified": false, "author_is_blue_verified": true, "author_verified_type": null}

Beyond price swings and retail hype, we’re witnessing a structural shift in supply, institutional adoption, and real-world AI deployments.\n\nHere’s a breakdown:\n\n1. From Inflation to Scarcity\n\nOn December 15, $TAO emissions were halved from 7,200 to 3,600 tokens daily, ending the high-inflation bootstrapping phase. \n\nThe result: a natural “shakeout,” transferring tokens from short-term holders to long-term compounding vaults.\n\n2. Institutional Validation\n\nSweden’s Virtune @VirtuneAB  launched the first regulated Bittensor ETP on Nasdaq Stockholm, giving pension funds and wealth managers regulated exposure to decentralized intelligence.\n\n@Grayscale's Bittensor Trust is filing Form 10, codifying $TAO as a commodity-grade digital asset. Institutional adoption is no longer a question, it’s here.\n\n3. Protocol Maturation: \n\nWith a cap at 128 active subnets, Bittensor fosters a hyper-competitive environment.\n\nDynamic TAO (dTAO) directs emissions toward subnets providing the highest utility.\n\n4. Real-World AI Adoption\nBittensor isn’t just theoretical:\n\nVision AI @webuildscore at AVIA stations (Subnet 44) monitors 3,000+ stations across Europe for safety and efficiency.\n\nProject Rubicon @Rubicon_Bridge bridges Bittensor subnets to Base L2 via Chainlink CCIP, unlocking DeFi opportunities for subnet participants.\n\n@zeussubnet x @WeatherXM leverages decentralized weather forecasting for global premium datasets.\n\nSubnets across the network are producing enterprise-grade AI solutions spanning vision, NLP, diffusion models, and more.\n\n5. Market Opportunity\n\nPost-halving, supply pressure is cut while demand infrastructure (ETPs, Grayscale, EVM compatibility) is scaling. \n\nAccumulation during structural shifts, has historically yielded the best long-term outcomes.\n\n6. Why This Matters for Enterprises\n\nBittensor enables enterprises to access high-performance, domain-specific AI across all subnets in a scalable, cost-efficient way:\n\nContinuous Improvement Across Subnets: Weekly competitions and collaborative subnet networks produce models that are constantly evolving and improving.\n\nEnterprise-Grade AI at Fraction of the Cost: Companies can deploy models tailored to their proprietary data and workflows without hiring expensive ML teams, reducing costs by 70–90%.\n\nOpen, Transparent, and Attributable: All winning scripts are open-source and auditable, ensuring enterprises maintain control while benefiting from collective expertise across subnets.\n\nInteroperable and Multi-Domain: Subnets specialize in different tasks—from vision AI and language models to diffusion and forecasting—allowing enterprises to tap the specific AI capabilities they need without starting from scratch.\n\nSo, $TAO’s halving is the catalyst. Institutional adoption and real-world deployments are the fuel. \n\nNoise may suggest “price down,” but signal says “the protocol is structurally stronger than ever and it favors those who act strategically.\n\nAs 2026 approaches, all signs point to $TAO entering a new phase of growth. With scarcity, institutional adoption, and real-world subnet deployments aligning, #Bittensor is poised to explode in the year ahead.🚀\n\nImage: https://t.co/cZuMQCJgx3", "lang": "en", "is_reply": false, "conversation_id": "2004529125390979101", "in_reply_to_id": null, "url": "https://x.com/Robin_T100/status/2004529125390979101", "like_count": 254, "reply_count": 32, "retweet_count": 101, "quote_count": 3, "view_count": 5953, "author_username": "Robin_T100", "author_followers": 10216, "author_is_verified": false, "author_is_blue_verified": true, "author_verified_type": null}

They show the AI infrastructure financing bubble hitting physical constraints.\n\nOracle is down 33% because it pushed data center completion dates from 2027 to 2028 due to labor and materials shortages, while its bond yields blew out to 2009 levels and Blue Owl Capital walked away from a $10 billion financing deal over debt concerns. That’s a buildout execution problem, not an AI demand problem. Oracle’s remaining performance obligations hit $523 billion. They have more contracted AI business than they can physically deliver.\n\nCoreWeave is down 39% because 62% of its revenue comes from Microsoft, which declined to exercise a $12 billion capacity option in March. Add a 1,262% debt-to-equity ratio and GPU rental rates that dropped from $5.50/hour to $1.55/hour as supply caught up to demand. That’s a customer concentration and commoditization problem, not AI failing.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia is up 170% YTD. Microsoft’s AI run rate hit $13 billion, up 175% YoY. Google Cloud grew 31%. The actual AI layer is accelerating while the overleveraged infrastructure middlemen hit the wall that always comes when capital can be deployed faster than transformers and turbines can be manufactured.\n\nThis tells you exactly where the squeeze is: not in AI demand, but in the gap between financial ambition and physical reality.

Has this decline been driven by the computing era and new forms of work?\n\n2️⃣The Labor Market Stress Index has turned positive — and that is a bad sign.\nThis is a powerful metric created by @Alphractal to identify meaningful shifts in labor-market conditions, with an optimal adjustment that helps filter out the current divergence between the economy and employment.\nThe Labor Market Stress Index measures job-market strain through the acceleration of unemployment. It tracks the gap between the current unemployment rate and its 12-month low, capturing early signs of trend reversals, and combines this acceleration with the absolute unemployment level, weighted 70% and 30%, respectively. Both components are normalized over a 5-year historical window. Elevated readings highlight not only high unemployment but also rapid increases — conditions that have historically preceded recessions and signaled rising economic fragility.\n\n3️⃣The KC Fed Labor Market Conditions Index is falling.\nThe bigger issue is if it continues to decline and turns negative. Historically, every time this happened, a prolonged bear market followed in the broader economy. This metric is especially valuable because it aggregates 24 different labor-market indicators into a single measure.\n\nWe can say that a bear market is almost inevitable — but it takes time to materialize. What makes the current environment clearer is that these critical labor metrics continue to deteriorate despite the ongoing divergence: fewer formal jobs alongside an S&P 500 increasingly driven by artificial intelligence, a sector that generates relatively few formal jobs.\n\nIt is likely that by 2026, a major signal of weakness may emerge, and many analysts may characterize it as a potential AI bubble.\n\nOverall, we need to monitor labor-market conditions on a monthly basis.

But stacking daGama, Inference Labs, and XYO transforms that vulnerability into a fortress of verifiable intelligence. \n\nIt's not hype it's a deliberate pipeline that roots every decision in proof, converting uncertainty into reliable action. In logistics, where I've deployed AI for years, bad inputs cause cascading failures like misguided routes wasting fuel and time. This stack enforces truth end-to-end, slashing those errors by grounding data in human validation, cryptographic proofs, and physical anchors. \n\nThe result? Autonomous systems that don't guess they guarantee. daGama kicks off at the source, turning everyday human actions like check-ins and visits into community-verified context. Rewarded via $DGMA tokens, it filters out fake data that plagues platforms like Google Maps, where inflated reviews skew reality. Why it matters: AI gets pristine signals for navigation and discovery, avoiding the 20-30% efficiency losses from opaque models, as MIT studies highlight.\n\nInference Labs layers on zkML for transparent reasoning, generating cryptographic proofs for every inference without revealing sensitive data. With over 280 million on-chain proofs from their $6.3 million June 2025 funding round, it makes AI output auditable assets. From my deployments, black-box hallucinations tank trust in high-stakes automation think agents plotting impossible paths. Here, provable computations cut those risks, fostering confidence where it counts.\n\nXYO seals the deal with its DePIN network of 10M+ nodes, using Proof of Location and Origin to bind data immutably to the physical world. Fresh off its December 2025 Revolut listing, boosting its $55 million market cap, it counters GPS spoofing and supply chain fakes. This resilience isn't optional; it's what prevents AI drift in volatile environments like global logistics. These projects interlock in a powerful reinforcement loop:daGama feeds authentic, human-validated context to sharpen inputs. \n\nInference Labs processes it into verifiable intelligence, elevating accuracy. XYO anchors the flow with decentralized proofs, ensuring tamper-proof integrity. Clean data boosts zkML precision, proven outputs amplify data's worth, and physical validation halts reality gaps. For builders like me, this dismantles the trust barrier that's stalled AI adoption. \n\nI've witnessed centralized systems crumble under misaligned incentives, breeding rot and unreliability. This stack, born from real-world necessities, shifts AI from fragile guesses to robust guarantees. It's the blueprint for scalable autonomy.\n@dagama_world @inference_labs\n@OfficialXYO", "lang": "en", "is_reply": false, "conversation_id": "2004280133595574304", "in_reply_to_id": null, "url": "https://x.com/basato1234/status/2004280133595574304", "like_count": 80, "reply_count": 2, "retweet_count": 61, "quote_count": 1, "view_count": 1507, "author_username": "basato1234", "author_followers": 2880, "author_is_verified": false, "author_is_blue_verified": true, "author_verified_type": null}

So here are five major happenings from 2025 that are worth further comment.\n\nBig Thing 1: AI is reshaping us\nThere might be a debate about whether or not this is a bubble moment, but there is no doubt that AI products, and chatbots in particular, are now mainstream, entrenched, and reshaping how people get information. More time in chatbots means less time on traditional search, less time seeking out news sites, and more personalized information. But! It also increases the importance of person-to-person relationships, where each participant has real skin in the game. Even as we get more media from robots, we want more connection with humans. We want, and need, to share stories with each other. That’s an opportunity.\n\nBig Thing 2: YouTube is king\nEveryone within spitting distance of the New York Media Industrial Complex is obsessed with what’s happening at the TV stations, newspapers, and magazine empires, but they all are just mites in a bed that is built, made, and slept in by YouTube, which dominates news, commentary, and entertainment, and is well on the way to taking over not just our personal devices but also the living room. This was the year that Neal Mohan became the big, sexy boss that everyone wants to press flesh with. Next year could be the backlash—and if it happens, expect it to come from the conflict between the company’s “creator-first” messaging and the increasing abundance of AI-produced content (which is friendly to YouTube’s business model).\n\nBig Thing 3: Paramount Skydance acquired The Free Press\nWhen David Ellison’s company acquired Bari Weiss’s The Free Press, it was big news for obvious political and cultural reasons—and insider media gossip—but to me the most significant story was that a new text-focused news and opinion publication had started from scratch, grown to significant revenue based on direct subscriptions, and then sold for a major sum after just three years. The media was supposed to be dying! Turns out that there is room for new entrants. There is room for reinvention.\n\nBig Thing 4: Traditional media is washed out\nThere are a few traditional media institutions left standing—the New York Times, Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times, and a handful of others—but the year 2025 confirmed that almost every other traditional media institution has completely lost influence. Worse: their businesses may not be recoverable. This reality is not the same thing as saying the media business is dead—it’s just not going to look like it has looked for the last 100 years. Even some of the biggest titans of that era won’t make the leap to the new era. This year has confirmed that we’re firmly in rebuilding territory now, even if the chaos of social media obfuscates the progress.\n\nBig Thing 5: Direct relationships are the way forward\nThe traditional media system once thrived on direct relationships, with the big brands having built trust with their audiences over decades. That all fell to pieces in the social media era, when tech companies figured out how to best take advantage of the internet to monopolize attention and therefore ad dollars. The social media companies aren’t going to give up their riches any time soon, so the people who care about trustworthy media will have to build direct relationships with audiences all over again, except this time without relying on programmatic advertising and without letting the big platforms dictate what they can and can’t do with those audiences. In 2025, it has become clear that—because of platforms like Substack—publishers can benefit from network effects that a platform brings without having to sacrifice the control of their audience relationships.", "lang": "en", "is_reply": false, "conversation_id": "2004264461067026805", "in_reply_to_id": null, "url": "https://x.com/hamishmckenzie/status/2004264461067026805", "like_count": 14, "reply_count": 2, "retweet_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "view_count": 4678, "author_username": "hamishmckenzie", "author_followers": 29861, "author_is_verified": false, "author_is_blue_verified": true, "author_verified_type": null}

{"tweet_id": "2004249881662345359", "created_at": "Thu Dec 25 17:56:23 +0000 2025", "text": "strategic exit is the best option for founders stuck with good logos, low revenue\n\nyou have maybe 500k, maybe a million ARR, slow growth, a few million raised (high pref stack)\n\nthe series A market wants 10x growth and you're at 1.5x. the AI hype cycle means every big company is building what you built. and you're having honest conversations with yourself about whether this is the thing you want to grind on for another decade\n\nyou've started taking partnership calls. integrations. strategic conversations. you're wondering if any of these could turn into something more\n\nyou may have heard that the best acquisitions often start as partnership conversations. but there's a right way and a wrong way to make that transition\n\nthis is the playbook and a checklist for partnership conversation to strategic acquisition\n\nPart 1: Get Clear Before You Do Anything\n\nbefore you try to convert a single conversation, you need to answer questions you've probably been avoiding\n\n- write down why you want to exit. not the version that sounds good. what's actually true\n\n- separate external noise (competitor raises, market panic, exhaustion) from internal signal\n\n- is this your life's work or act one? neither answer is wrong but you need to know which one it is\n\n- define what success looks like in real numbers. be specific\n\nunderstand this: once you commit to selling, every decision optimizes for that outcome. you can't half-commit to an exit\n\nthe founders who struggle most are the ones running parallel tracks - trying to raise and trying to sell simultaneously. investors can smell it. acquirers can smell it. pick a lane\n\nPart 2: Map Your Buyer Universe\n\nyou probably have 3-4 companies in your head that \"might acquire us someday\"\n\nthat's not enough. you need 20+\n\n- list every company where your product could extend their roadmap\n\n- research acquisition history. have they bought companies at your stage? your size?\n\n- find founders they acquired. cold outreach if you have to. ask: how did it happen, who made the decision, what did the process look like\n\n- identify overlapping customers. shared customers = easier integration story = higher willingness to pay\n\n- understand their product roadmap. where's the gap you fill?\n\n- note the financial structure of these companies, which companies have PE backing, which are venture funded, which are profitable, etc - try to figure out if they have cash to pay (it'll also help positioning it the right way with your investors and the board)\n\nmost founders skip this work and then wonder why they only got one lowball offer\n\nPart 3: Reading Signals in Partnership Conversations\n\nyou're already talking to potential acquirers. you just might not know which ones yet\n\nsignals they're only interested in partnership:\n\n- questions about APIs, SLAs, integration timelines\n- focus stays on product mechanics\n- conversation moves at normal business development pace\n- only BD or product people in the room\n\nsignals something bigger might be brewing:\n\n- questions about financials, runway, team size, your plans\n- asking what you're thinking or where you're headed\n- questions that go beyond partnership scope\n- unusual urgency in scheduling follow-ups\n- senior people showing up unexpectedly\n- they start asking about your team's background and experience\n\nif there's real acquisition interest, they won't wait for you to be obvious. they'll start asking the questions themselves\n\nPart 4: The Slow Reveal\n\nyou cannot go from \"let's discuss API integration\" to \"want to buy us?\" in one conversation. that's how you kill deals before they start\n\nstage 1 - relationship building (weeks 1-8)\n- keep conversations product-focused\n- build genuine rapport with people who matter\n- understand their problems, roadmap gaps, strategic priorities\n- gather intel on decision makers and internal politics\n- do not mention acquisition. do not hint\n\nstage 2 - strategic alignment (weeks 8-16)\n\n- start discussing how your product fits their long-term roadmap\n- share your perspective on where the market is going\n- let them connect the dots between your capabilities and their gaps\n- ask about their build vs buy philosophy (this is recon, not a pitch)\n- still don't mention acquisition explicitly\n\nstage 3 - soft signal (only when you sense reciprocal interest)\n\n- mention you're \"thinking about the next chapter\" or \"exploring what's next\"\n- gauge reaction carefully. do they lean in or change subject?\n- clarifying questions = interest. moving on = not interested\n- if they bite, you can be slightly more direct: \"we've had some inbound interest and we're figuring out what makes sense\"\n\nstage 4 - explicit conversation (only after you have another horse in the race)\n\n- once a different company is formally diligencing you, now you can be obvious with others\n- this creates urgency without desperation\n- \"we're in conversations with a couple of strategic partners about potential acquisition and wanted to see if [company] might be interested\"\n- never be obvious before you have at least one real process running\n\nPart 5: Timing the \"Obvious\" Moment\n\nthis is where most founders mess up. they either reveal too early (desperation) or too late (no leverage)\n\ntoo early to be obvious:\n- no one has expressed formal acquisition interest\n- you haven't mapped the full buyer universe\n- you don't have runway to walk away from a bad deal\n- you're hoping someone will rescue you\n\nright time to be obvious:\n- one company has explicitly said they're diligencing you for acquisition\n- you've signed mutual NDAs\n- their team is actively reviewing your business\n- you have enough runway to negotiate from strength\n\ntoo late:\n- after you've signed a term sheet with exclusivity\n- now you can't talk to anyone else and you have no leverage\n\nremember once you're obvious, word travels fast in your market. competitors will use it against you with shared prospects. customers may get nervous about signing annual contracts. there is no going back\n\nPart 6: Separating Real Interest from Noise\n\nyou'll waste months chasing phantom interest if you can't tell the difference\n\nit's real when:\n- they send an NDA or ask you to send one\n-they explicitly use the word \"acquisition\" not \"partnership\" or \"strategic opportunity\"\n- they want financials, cap table, customer contracts\n- conversations accelerate rapidly (weeks not months)\n- decision makers are in the room or on the call\n- corp dev gets involved (but is not only team) \n- they're asking about your team's retention and equity situation\n\nit's noise when:\n- conversations drag with no clear next steps\n- they keep exploring but never commit to anything\n- questions stay surface level\n- only junior people are involved\n- they're vague about timeline or process\n- they want to \"keep talking\" indefinitely\n\nslow conversations mean low interest. if they wanted you, they'd move fast. real deals happen in weeks. fake interest drags for months\n\nPart 7: Running a Competitive Process\n\nyou have almost no leverage with one buyer. you have significant leverage with two or more\n- never negotiate with just one party if you can avoid it\n- use diligence with company A to create urgency with companies B and C\n- verbal offers or term sheets are your key leverage points\n- once you sign a term sheet you're usually in exclusivity - that's your last moment to create competition\n- maintain warm relationships with backup buyers throughout the process\n- warm relationships convert 10x faster than cold outreach when you need them\n\na sample phrase that creates urgency: \"we're in active discussions with another party and expect to have a term sheet soon. wanted to give you a chance to participate in the process if there's interest\"\n\nPart 8: Protecting the Business During the Process\n\nacquisitions fall through constantly. you cannot let your business die while chasing a deal\n- assume anything you share could reach competitors\n- be careful what you reveal before NDAs are signed\n- competitors may weaponize \"they're trying to sell\" against you with shared customers\n- keep your team focused on execution. tell them nothing until there's something real to tell\n- don't let pipeline die. keep selling. keep shipping\n- a business that's still growing is worth more than one that stalled during a sale process\n\nPart 9: Understanding Valuation Reality\n\nmost founders have no idea how acquirers actually value companies at your stage\n\nstrategic acquisition math:\n- buyer pays based on strategic value to them, not your revenue multiple\n- what gap do you fill? what do they avoid building? what customers do you bring?\n- lightning in a bottle is possible (someone pays $50M for a $600k ARR company) but it's not the median case\n- your leverage: competing interest, strategic fit, team quality, technology moat, customer relationships\n\nfinancial acquisition math:\n- buyer pays based on cash flow potential\n- at sub-$5M ARR, multiples are compressed (often 1-3x)\n- they're buying a small business, not a strategic asset\n- outcome often goes to founders OR investors, rarely both\n- proceed only if you're okay with smaller numbers\n\nthe gap between these two is massive. a strategic buyer might pay $30M for something a financial buyer values at $1.5M. know which game you're playing\n\nPart 10: The Process Timeline\n\nknowing what normal looks like helps you spot when things are off\n\ntypical timeline:\n- initial interest to term sheet: 4-12 weeks\n- term sheet to close: 6-12 weeks\n- fastest deals (strong buyer need, clean company): 2-3 weeks to term sheet\n- slow deals (lukewarm interest): drag for months, often die\n\nkey milestones in order:\n- first conversation that goes beyond partnership\n- explicit statement of acquisition interest\n- mutual NDA signed\n- data room access shared\n- management presentations / deep dives\n- verbal offer\n- written LOI or term sheet\n- exclusivity period begins\n- full legal and financial diligence\n- definitive agreement signed\n- close and wire\n\nif you're stuck between steps for more than 2-3 weeks with no clear reason, something is wrong\n\nPart 11: Who to Cultivate, Who to Deprioritize\n\nyour time is limited. spend it on people who can actually make things happen\n\nprioritize:\n- founders who sold to your target buyers (best intel you'll get)\n- people with direct line to decision makers\n- product leaders who own the roadmap you'd fit into\n- corp dev if the company has an active M&A function\n- executives who would sponsor the deal internally\n\ndeprioritize:\n- people who can't influence decisions no matter how friendly they are\n- BD folks with no strategic authority\n- anyone who seems to be collecting intel rather than evaluating\n- junior employees who take meetings but can't escalate\n\none warm intro to the right person beats twenty coffees with the wrong people\n\nPart 12: Red Flags to Watch For\n\nnot everyone negotiating with you has your interests in mind\n- buyer trying to extract IP through \"partnership\" before acquiring (or instead of acquiring)\n- endless diligence with no movement toward term sheet\n- verbal offers that never become written\n- term sheets with unusual conditions, aggressive reps and warranties, or escrow that eats your proceeds\n- pressure for exclusivity before they've given you real terms\n- acqui-hire framing when they're really getting product + customers + team\n- \"we need more time\" repeated more than once\n- radio silence after you've shared sensitive information\ntrust your gut. if something feels off, it probably is\n\nthe meta point:\n\nmost founders in your situation know the options. the hard part isn't knowing what to do. it's deciding which path and committing fully\n\nhalf-committed founders get half-committed outcomes. you can't simultaneously optimize for series A and strategic exit. pick the path that matches your internal motivation - not what vcs are telling you, not what other founders are doing, not what your investors want\n\nthen execute against that path with everything you have\n\nthe founders who get the best outcomes are the ones who answer the hard questions early, commit to a direction, and make every subsequent decision in service of that outcome\n\ngood luck", "lang": "en", "is_reply": false, "conversation_id": "2004249881662345359", "in_reply_to_id": null, "url": "https://x.com/rohitdotmittal/status/2004249881662345359", "like_count": 610, "reply_count": 21, "retweet_count": 35, "quote_count": 6, "view_count": 104123, "author_username": "rohitdotmittal", "author_followers": 22707, "author_is_verified": false, "author_is_blue_verified": true, "author_verified_type": null}

It's rebuilding discovery from the ground up with proof-of-presence: real check-ins, on-chain verified photos and videos, rewards for honest contributions. In a world drowning in sponsored lists and bot ratings, this feels like a breath of fresh air. Trust isn't assumed; it's earned through immutable actions. Their recent tie-up with WORLD3 hints at autonomous agents exploring real locations with verifiable anchors, turning maps into living, trustworthy ecosystems.\n\nInference Labs takes the harder path in decentralized AI. While others flood markets with unproven agents, they demand cryptographic receipts for every inference. TruthTensor's massive experiment, 100,000+ agents tested against live Polymarket outcomes, exposed what matters: performance against reality, not slick demos. Their zk-proof tools, accelerated by partners like Cysic, make black-box decisions auditable, essential for anything high-stakes like robotics or finance. This isn't flashy growth; it's building the trust layer AI desperately needs to scale without collapsing under doubt.\n\nLightLink Chain plays the enabler role perfectly. An Ethereum L2 focused on simplicity, gasless flows, and instant execution, it removes the friction that kills real-world adoption. Projects like daGama thrive here because seamless transactions let human signals flow into on-chain intelligence without users noticing the tech underneath.\n\nTogether, these aren't isolated bets. daGama grounds data in physical truth. Inference Labs proves the intelligence. LightLink delivers it frictionlessly. The result: a stack where human exploration fuels verifiable agents, creating discovery loops that feel authentic, not engineered.\n\nThe insight? Web3 wins when it solves broken trust in everyday experiences, reviews, recommendations, decisions, not just financial primitives.\n\nWatch these spaces closely. Contribute a real check-in, deploy a proven agent, or build on smooth rails. The future of grounded intelligence starts with deliberate participation today.\n\n#DGMA  #RealWorldDiscovery  #InferenceLabs #VerifiableAI #LightLinkChain", "lang": "en", "is_reply": false, "conversation_id": "2004194693035291069", "in_reply_to_id": null, "url": "https://x.com/MS_Khaleefa/status/2004194693035291069", "like_count": 84, "reply_count": 3, "retweet_count": 80, "quote_count": 1, "view_count": 1230, "author_username": "MS_Khaleefa", "author_followers": 2273, "author_is_verified": false, "author_is_blue_verified": true, "author_verified_type": null}

Founded in 2019, they didn’t start with flashy humanoids. They built the stack first: collaborative robots, mobile platforms, proprietary sensors, control software, and their own AI system. That matters because humanoids don’t exist in isolation. They sit at the top of a deep automation layer.\n\nTheir humanoid, 4NE-1 (For Anyone), reflects this thinking. It’s not a demo robot. It’s a general-purpose labor unit designed for factories, logistics, and eventually human environments. Powered by AURA AI, multimodal perception, sensor skin, and voice interaction it’s built to execute real work, not just scripted movements.\n\nWhat really aligns NEURA with the Physical AI thesis is the platform approach. Through Neuraverse, robots gain new capabilities over time. That reframes robots from fixed machines into upgradeable economic assets. Software logic, embodied in hardware.\n\nAnd the real signal isn’t videos it’s traction. €120M+ Series B. Rapid team expansion. Reported €1B order backlog. Cognitive robotics is already being priced into reality.\n\nZooming out, this is where @xmaquina becomes critical.\n\nMost companies shaping Physical AI at this layer NEURA included are private. They’re defining humanoid labor long before IPO narratives exist. @xmaquina isn’t just observing this shift. It’s creating structured access to the private Physical AI economy through a DAO-native model.\n\nScrolling through the DAO allocations, a pattern emerges :\n\n❇️ Figure AI. \n❇️ 1X. \n❇️ Apptronik. \n❇️ Agility. \n❇️ NEURA.\n\nThis isn’t about betting on one robot.\nIt’s about mapping the full humanoid stack perception, cognition, actuation, deployment.\n\n➤ Humanoids are becoming labor infrastructure. \n\n➤ Physical AI is becoming programmable capital. \n\n➤ Ownership remains gated\n\nThat’s the gap @xmaquina + $DEUS is trying to close  giving the community exposure to the companies, platforms, and supply chains that will define autonomous work before it’s fully financialized by public markets.\n\nFrom a 2026 lens, this feels clear to me :\n\n📌 Humanoid robotics won’t arrive as a headline.\n📌 It will accumulate quietly node by node, system by system.\n\nThe value of @xmaquina isn’t short-term excitement. It’s co-owning the structural foundations of an ecosystem that hasn’t fully surfaced yet.\n\nHumanoids won’t be an event.\nThey’ll be an economy.

Not because of hype around humanoids, but because of how they were built.\n\nNEURA didn’t start with a flashy humanoid reveal. They spent years building the layers underneath: collaborative robots, mobile systems, proprietary sensors, control software, and their own AI stack. That sequence matters. Humanoids don’t stand alone, they sit on top of an automation foundation that has to work reliably in the real world.\n\nWhen you look at 4NE-1 through that lens, it feels less like a demo robot and more like an attempt at general-purpose labor. A system meant to operate across factories, logistics, and eventually human spaces. Multimodal perception, sensor skin, voice interaction, not for show, but to execute tasks repeatedly, under constraints.\n\nWhat really clicks for me is the platform logic. Robots that improve over time through software upgrades stop being fixed machines. They start behaving like economic assets. That’s Physical AI in practice, not theory.\n\nThe signal isn’t videos. It’s traction.\nCapital raised. Orders booked. Teams scaling. Demand showing up before public markets even have a narrative for it.\n\nZooming out, this is where @xmaquina feels well positioned.Most companies shaping Physical AI at this depth are still private. Value is being created quietly, long before IPO headlines. Xmaquina isn’t trying to predict this shift. it’s building structured access to it through a DAO-native approach.\n\nHumanoids are becoming labor infrastructure.\nPhysical AI is becoming programmable capital.\n\nThe gap is access. And that’s the gap $DEUS is designed to close.\n\nThis isn’t about watching robots scroll by on a timeline. It’s about understanding where the economic layer is forming, and choosing to stand there early, with intention.", "lang": "en", "is_reply": false, "conversation_id": "2003990980169814486", "in_reply_to_id": null, "url": "https://x.com/0xSkepto/status/2003990980169814486", "like_count": 42, "reply_count": 16, "retweet_count": 21, "quote_count": 1, "view_count": 7402, "author_username": "0xSkepto", "author_followers": 2896, "author_is_verified": false, "author_is_blue_verified": true, "author_verified_type": null}

I'll only focus on these two for the sake of example.\n\nIt's not about Nvidia and OpenAI being unaware of what's happening. They know that they're in trouble.\n\nRather, it's a coordinated effort by the FIC, CIC, and TIC to keep this bubble going for as long as possible.\n\nFor example, Nvidia 'invests' $100 billion into OpenAi.\n\nKeep in mind that Nvidia only sits on about $60 billion in short term assets, cash on hand, etc.\n\nSo what's going on?\n\nNvidia, which doesn't have enough to commit to $100 billion into OpenAI upfront...\n\n...Instead gives shares of their company to OpenAI which they get money back in exchange from OpenAI.\n\nThey take this money and reinvest that same money back into OpenAI again while OpenAI buys Nvidia's GPUs and RAM, so Nvidia gets some cash back to keep the scheme going.\n\nIn a nutshell, stock evaluations come from the same recycled cash flows switching hands back and forth.\n\nIt's like me giving you $100 and you give me that $100 back. Yeah, we both made money, but it's back in my hands.\n\nThere isn't any *new* money entering into this hype-fueled tech ecosystem.\n\nIt's like a form of leverage where the cash going back and forth is able to buy more shares but without the margin.\n\nAnd the real problem is that OpenAI's products don't make money on their own merit. Companies are paying money hand over fist to try figure out a way to make ROI. Google, Amazon, Meta, etc.\n\nThese products are basically a collective black hole where money disappears or it never existed in the first place, except on paper.\n\nThat's because there isn't much to gain from the AI itself. It's basically just a much more powerful chatbot or search engine.\n\nIt's not truly 'artificial intelligence' because that would imply the machine is truly sentient, which it's not.\n\nChatGPT is more of a neat tool to use rather than a human's replacement. I think it's cool, but I don't see it magically replacing jobs. Rather, humans with 'AI' will be at an advantage against those without it.\n\nThere are other examples, one of them being the software AI Devin. It flopped after experienced coders found that it couldn't deliver.\n\nAnyway:\n\nThe ordinary person like you and I see that it's a bubble.\n\nThe FIC, CIC, and TIC all know it's a bubble, but that's not the point.\n\nIt's not about preventing it from popping. \n\nIt's about *not* getting stuck holding the bag.\n\nOnce the music stops, those who don't have the money on hand get burned.\n\nSam Altman has seen the balance sheets, that I can be sure of. His company is running at a massive operating loss and it's only continuing to get worse.\n\nBut for now, he's got the FIC filling in the backstop to boost the stocks of the companies that have partnered with him such as Nvidia.\n\nCompanies like OpenAI simply serve the purpose of inflating other companies' share prices for those looking to exit at a later time.\n\nBlackRock, StateStreet, Vanguard, and other FIC institutional investors have stock in both these companies, which means they're a source of short term liquidity.\n\nThey're waiting for when B2B demand for GPUs and tech can't keep up with the cash flows that are underwriting it.\n\nOnce GPUs and data centers become to expensive for this house of cards to support, then it's time to sell.\n\nBasically we have a multi-trillion dollar, AI chatbot ponzi scheme that'll unleash chaos on tech company balance sheets while the FIC cashes out.\n\nWe're not going from ChatGPT to Skynet. That's silly.\n\nBut what we will see is something like this:\n\n- FIC will signal that the bubble is about to burst by being the first to cash out.\n- More layoffs will happen not because of AI automation, but because these companies don't make money and have no cash on hand.\n- The a-national private sector (APS) will use the excuse of AI automation to quietly disguise the outsourcing of more jobs.\n- Unproductive AI-based jobs won't be coming back because they were a result of resource misallocation in the first place.\n\nIt's the collusion of people like Sam Altman, Jensen Huang, and others in the CIC/TIC working with the FIC to coordinate their exits.\n\nThe individuals cash out, the AI bubble bursts, FIC liquidates positions and then swoops in to buy startups for pennies on the dollar to capture IPs.\n\nThose new companies start another hype-fueled bubble, bringing more smaller companies into their orbit.\n\nRinse and repeat.\n\n--\n\nAlso, Merry Christmas everyone.

I've spent weeks dissecting their interplay, and it's clear: this isn't just tech it's a safeguard against bad decisions in high-stakes worlds like logistics or urban planning. By anchoring AI in verifiable reality, it shifts from guesswork to precision, saving time and resources where errors cost millions.\n\nDaGama redefines mapping from the ground up. Their Real World Location (RWL) protocol on Arbitrum lets users earn $DGMA tokens by validating physical spots through repeated visits and building unmanipulated trust scores. Imagine AI directing a delivery drone not to a sponsored ghost address, but to a café verified by 60,000 daily explorers across 360,000 wallets this erases fake data noise and empowers community-driven accuracy that traditional maps can't match.Why does this matter? In my view, it's the antidote to biased inputs that plague AI today. Without it, smart cities risk optimizing for profit over people, like routing traffic through ad-heavy zones. daGama's bias-free approach ensures AI sees the world as it is, fostering equitable decisions that feel earned, not engineered.\n\nInference Labs elevates that foundation with cryptographic accountability. Their zkML \"Proof of Inference\" verifies AI reasoning without exposing models, processing 283 million proofs since their $6.3 million funding round in June 2025. Think of it as a black box turned transparent: in regulated fields like healthcare, you audit why an AI flagged a supply chain issue, preventing hallucinations that could halt operations. This scalability without bloat is game-changing. From experience observing AI deployments, unchecked outputs lead to cascading failures. Inference labs' method lets you prove every step, building investor confidence and regulatory compliance. It's not fluff; it's the difference between adopting AI broadly or shelving it due to distrust.\n\nXYO seals the deal with ironclad source truth. Their network of over 10 million nodes, upgraded in September 2025 with $XL1 staking, cryptographically stamps locations as immutable facts. If daGama verifies a spot, XYO ensures no tampering en route to the AI, recently boosted by their Revolut listing for wider adoption. Here's the power in stacking them:Reality from daGama grounds inputs.Provable reasoning via Inference Labs audits the process. Source-level verification by XYO locks in integrity. Together, they create verifiable intelligence that scales. \n\nFor instance, in autonomous logistics, this stack could cut errors by 50% by cross-validating a truck's route against real-time, tamper-proof datasomething I've seen prototypes struggle without. My take: This isn't incremental; it's transformative. \n\nInvestors eyeing AI infrastructure should prioritize such stacks for long-term viability as regulations tighten on unverified tech. Developers integrate these for apps that users actually rely on, not just demo. It's a call to build with intention, turning AI from a toy into a tool that drives real progress. @dagama_world @inference_labs @OfficialXYO", "lang": "en", "is_reply": false, "conversation_id": "2003910905025724653", "in_reply_to_id": null, "url": "https://x.com/basato1234/status/2003910905025724653", "like_count": 94, "reply_count": 1, "retweet_count": 68, "quote_count": 1, "view_count": 1531, "author_username": "basato1234", "author_followers": 2880, "author_is_verified": false, "author_is_blue_verified": true, "author_verified_type": null}

The central question is no longer whether systems can function, but who captures value, under which rules, and with what level of accountability.\n\n📈 AI is entering a results-driven phase.\nBy 2025, measurable return on investment becomes a baseline expectation. Agentic systems show promise but remain early. Certain segments, such as video generation, continue to face high capital costs and monetization challenges. Infrastructure quality increasingly outweighs speed of deployment.\n\n⚖️ The reason Sahara exists:\nThe current AI economy is structurally imbalanced. Data providers, model contributors, and tool builders generate value but lack transparency, leverage, and predictable upside.\n\n🔗 Sahara addresses this at the infrastructure layer, enabling contribution, usage, and revenue to be tracked and programmed across the AI stack. This approach is designed as a value-flow system rather than a marketplace abstraction.\n\n🏢 Enterprise adoption provides validation.\nSean highlighted active collaborations with Amazon, Alibaba, JD, and https://t.co/YWIzeV9A8z. These relationships demonstrate real-world demand, non-speculative revenue, and the ability to invest in long-term infrastructure without reliance on market cycles.\n\n🤖 On the agentic economy:\nToday, autonomous agents lack mechanisms to transact with one another, prove contribution, or enforce policy constraints. Sahara’s X402 extensions aim to enable agent-to-agent interaction, function-level attribution, and verifiable execution under defined rules.\n\n🧩 Tyler Zhou (COO & Co-Founder): Products That Earn Trust\n🛠️ Crypto Copilot is positioned as a proactive assistant.\nTyler clarified that the product is not intended to function as a conversational interface. Its purpose is to understand context, reduce cognitive load, and support better daily decision-making.\n\n🧪 The rationale behind a limited beta:\nThe external beta prioritizes signal over exposure. Controlled access allows workflows to be stress-tested, usage patterns to emerge, and assumptions to be refined before broader release. Correctness and trust take precedence over speed.\n\n🔄 Long-term product direction:\nInfrastructure has limited impact without products that users engage with consistently. This perspective highlights Sahara’s gradual transition from enterprise-focused deployments toward broader utility built on proven foundations.\n\n⏳ Tokens, Transparency, and Time Horizons\n📊 Recent market volatility was addressed directly.\nThere was no spot selling by the team or investors, and no contract or security issues were identified. Price movement resulted from derivatives activity and thin liquidity. Vesting schedules and long-term incentive structures remain unchanged.\n\n🌱 The broader message emphasized durability over reaction.\nShort-term price fluctuations carry limited meaning. Trust and credibility accumulate over time.\n\n🔮 Looking Ahead to 2026\n✅ Approaches likely to endure:\nAI systems with real users, infrastructure with measurable value flow, and products designed for sustained engagement.\n\n❌ Approaches likely to fade:\nNarrative-driven agent projects and systems lacking economic grounding.\n\n🧩 Sahara’s positioning reflects deliberate design.\nAn agent-native, value-aware infrastructure already validated through enterprise adoption and now expanding carefully toward broader participation.\n\n✨ In summary:\nThis AMA focused on what Sahara is actively building and solving today, and why those solutions remain relevant as the ecosystem evolves.\n\n🔗 https://t.co/zBys6HgrL6\n\n#AIforAll #SaharaAI", "lang": "en", "is_reply": false, "conversation_id": "2003878647820652963", "in_reply_to_id": null, "url": "https://x.com/armediaryl/status/2003878647820652963", "like_count": 62, "reply_count": 58, "retweet_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "view_count": 1895, "author_username": "armediaryl", "author_followers": 1935, "author_is_verified": false, "author_is_blue_verified": true, "author_verified_type": null}

We get it, You are bearish on AI. But when it comes to your your companies, it is ok to be overleveraged?\n\nAI stocks are trading at some of the cheapest multiple in stock market history comparing to the $COST and $WMT. \n\nOh $COST and $WMT will be well on its way to Foward P/E 45-50x+ as we grow stronger in 2026. \n\nThe notion of an \"AI bubble\" ready to burst has dominated headlines or fake news throughout 2025, fueled by sky-high valuations, massive capital expenditures on data centers, and comparisons to the dot-com era. Critics point to concentrated market gains where AI leader stocks drove much of the S&P 500's performance and reports of limited immediate returns on generative AI investments, such as a MIT study claiming 95% of organizations saw zero ROI despite billions spent. Yet, this bubble thesis overstates the risks while underestimating AI's foundational differences from past speculative frenzies.\n\nUnlike the dot-com bubble, where many companies lacked viable business models and profitability paths, today's AI leaders are grounded in robust fundamentals. Nvidia, the poster child for AI valuations, has delivered blockbuster earnings with surging revenue and margins, backed by real demand from hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google... \n\nThe massive  infrastructure buildout projected at over $1 trillion in coming years is to service massive intellgient demand. Pst \"bubbles\" in electricity, telephony, and broadband involved heavy upfront spending that appeared irrational at the time but enabled enduring economic progress. AI's compute demands are similarly structural but sovereign nations and enterprises are committing billions to \"sovereign AI\" initiatives, with binding contracts signaling long-term commitment not hype!\n\nConcerns about circular deals or overconcentration are valid, but the demand in insatiable. We can debate about how CapEx is funded for different companies, but rapdi productivity gain often accelerate innovation and adoption, not bubble. Valuation has corrected sharply in such a short time as investors/funds rotating more to Financial, Energy and Health Care, which will probably pull back in 2026 as they are very crowded trade. And Financial, Energy and Health Care will not outperform AI Leaders on Earning and Revenue growth \n\nBears labeling AI \"bubble\" over and over are exaggerating bearish sentiment, but it has not changed Revenue and Earning growth. Fundamental is actually accelerating like $AMD EPS will grow triple digits in 2026 as well as its Revenue due to explosive Hardware and Software maturity. \n\nDon't be too Bearish.\n\nNot Financial Advice!", "lang": "en", "is_reply": false, "conversation_id": "2003500913026056433", "in_reply_to_id": null, "url": "https://x.com/MikeLongTerm/status/2003500913026056433", "like_count": 15, "reply_count": 1, "retweet_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "view_count": 2789, "author_username": "MikeLongTerm", "author_followers": 20131, "author_is_verified": false, "author_is_blue_verified": true, "author_verified_type": null}

Here, success isn’t measured by flashy compute benchmarks or hype cycles; it’s measured by real-world usage and tangible impact. Every model you ship, every dataset you contribute, and every compute cycle you provide is tracked and rewarded on-chain. Bugs surface quickly, uptime matters, and every input/output is verifiable, giving contributors real accountability and value for their work.\n\nBuilt on Base, transaction fees are under $0.01 while maintaining $ETH-grade security, which makes iterating cheap and frictionless. The PoWR system ranks models by actual usage, meaning builders earn from requests and utility not speculation or marketing noise. Quick playbook: ship a model or tool, wire your data and compute, register PoWR metrics, hit uptime targets, track your scoreboard, and get rewarded from real demand.\n\nWhat makes it truly standout is the multi-domain approach: healthcare, fraud detection, trading, and more all live in the same open stack. It’s rare to find a network where contributions actually matter, where builders are prioritized over hype, and where the ecosystem feels genuinely designed to grow with its participants. Spending time here makes you realize it’s not just about building AI it’s about building a fair, accountable, and sustainable community that rewards the people actually making it happen.\n\nIf you care about honest AI, impactful models, and a system that rewards real work instead of empty promises, @DeepNodeAI is the arena where it all comes together.", "lang": "en", "is_reply": false, "conversation_id": "2003347714302452019", "in_reply_to_id": null, "url": "https://x.com/AbdulDgreat/status/2003347714302452019", "like_count": 144, "reply_count": 187, "retweet_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "view_count": 1435, "author_username": "AbdulDgreat", "author_followers": 3667, "author_is_verified": false, "author_is_blue_verified": true, "author_verified_type": null}
